I had to cancel the order immediately due to incorrect shipping and then re-order. My bank ( since the item was purchased via debit card via third party ) didnt reflect the charge as the item hadnt been processed yet ( it was cancelled ) but the second order had gone through, item was shipped and was received promptly. 

Fast forward to XXXX XXXX I was charged by PayPal again for the item I had already paid for ( debited transaction proof in statements ) and received the item. I understand that due to the cancellation, their payment systems go wonky so I figured this would be an easy fix. 

I open a support ticket for PayPal, XXXX, and my bank providing all necessary proof with statements and a detailed description describing what had happened. My bank investigated and obliged my request. XXXX looked through the transactions and explained it was nearly a hold and the funds will be returned ( which they were ). 

PayPal responded by locking my account, claiming I reversed a charge. They closed my support ticket and found their records to be correct. They left me XXXX option for rebuttal or even a means to contact a customer service rep so I can explain the situation. I have a strong feeling that my case wasnt even heard/reviewed and I was penalized in spite of being a long-time customer. With that, I was charged a dispute fee which they do not mention until you read their fine print. It was not even shown in my recent activity/balance as a deducted charge, money was just missing. 

Becoming increasingly fed up, I decided that I was going to close my PayPal account. Doing so has been a near impossibility. Their instructions detail that you can do this easily through their app, but when you click close account it takes you to their support page FAQ and when you type in close account on the search bar, they provide instructions that take you right back to step one.

04-01-2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a detailed complaint against Popular Bank concerning an ATM deposit discrepancy and the bank 's subsequent handling of my claims. On XX/XX/XXXX, at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX, I attempted to deposit three XXXX bills ( {$300.00} in total ) into my account ( ID XXXX ) at ATM # XXXX. The machine only processed two of the bills, resulting in a deposit of only {$100.00} into my account, despite all bills being genuine. ( The machine kept two {$100.00} bills and returned back one to me. ) Upon noticing the error of only {$100.00} being credited to my account, I filed a claim with Popular Bank within 48 hours of the incident, on XX/XX/XXXX. I was assigned claim number XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response via regular mail in which the bank acknowledged the possibility of an error but concluded that the claimed error did not occur. The letter 's contradictory nature and the repeated mention of an "" error '' raised concerns about the thoroughness of the investigation. 

Following the bank 's advice, I requested the documents used to base their decision. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received truncated documents. However, with my background as a XXXX XXXX, I identified two distinct timestamps that corroborated my claim : genuine notes were detected at XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, validating that two {$100.00} bills were accepted by the ATM. 

I contacted the bank again on XX/XX/XXXX, speaking with an employee named XXXX XXXX. I explained how the documents supported my claim and requested a further review of my case. XXXX XXXX opened a new claim, number XXXX. However, the response to this claim was a dismissive letter that failed to address the specific facts of my situation and stated that the case was closed. 

In-Person Visit and Lack of Follow-Up : As a last resort, on XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' branch of Popular Bank and discussed my situation with the branch manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Despite acknowledging the discrepancy highlighted by the timestamps, she informed me that the ATMs are managed by a third-party and implied that the branch could not resolve the issue directly. This visit, recommended by one of the bank 's letters, resulted in further disappointment due to misdirection and lack of subsequent communication promised by the branch manager. 

Current Status : As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, there has been no follow-up contact from the bank or any progress toward resolving my complaint. This series of interactions not only highlights the financial loss but also illustrates a pattern of disregard for customer concerns and a lack of accountability from Popular Bank. 

The bank 's handling of my claims has been disdainful and unempathetic, causing significant distress and loss of productive hours. The lack of professionalism and failure to adequately investigate and address the discrepancy has compelled me to seek assistance from the CFPB. 

I respectfully request the CFPB 's intervention to ensure a comprehensive investigation is conducted and to help facilitate a fair resolution.

Finally, I called XXXX and stated that I wanted to dispute the charge, and informed XXXX that there was neither a way to submit a dispute online or, for that matter, to report possible fraud. I asked XXXX to take a dispute from me. XXXX refused to do so, but stated that it would close my account and would refer the matter to its fraud department.

12/16/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"XXXX XXXX XXXXResolution SpecialistRegulatory ComplaintsBank of America Dear XXXX XXXX, My grandfather always taught me to get to the root of an issue, and his advice resonates now more than ever : "" If you want the truth, let the person speak. '' I appreciate the time you took to document Bank of Americas response on XX/XX/year>, but there are several inaccuracies in your timeline and handling of this matter that must be addressed. 

First, your claim that we first contacted Bank of America ( BOA ) on XX/XX/year>, is incorrect. Our initial contact with BOA occurred around XX/XX/year>, regarding our concerns with XXXX. This timeline is critical to our case, as it establishes the prolonged efforts we made to resolve the matter directly with XXXX and the subsequent delays caused by BOAs handling of our claim. I personally spoke to a BOA representative on XX/XX/XXXX, explaining in detail that we paid XXXX directly for services that were never rendered by the vendors promoted on their platform. I also emphasized that we had a thorough paper trail documenting our attempts to resolve the issue with XXXX, which included numerous emails over the course of four months. 

Despite XXXX claim of responding within 72 hours, they failed to provide any meaningful support or resolution. It wasnt until late XX/XX/year>, after repeated follow-ups and escalating frustration, that XXXX finally respondedonly after I used strong language to prompt a reply. These emails, including timestamps, were submitted to BOA as part of our case documentation. 

Second, your statement that I contacted BOA on XX/XX/year>, to dispute multiple claims is also incorrect. I called on that date because a BOA supervisor advised me to follow up for an update on my XX/XX/XXXX claim. To my dismay, the agent I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX informed me that no record of the claim submitted on XX/XX/XXXX could be found. I was asked to resend the claim to the same fax number I had used previously, for which I have proof of receipt. This mishandling of my claim caused unnecessary delays and further exacerbated my frustration. 

Third, your assertion that my XX/XX/year>, submission fell outside the dispute timeframe lacks clarity and transparency. I have repeatedly requested a written explanation of the specific timeframe BOA follows, yet none has been provided. Based on our timeline, this process began on XX/XX/year>, when your agent advised us to continue seeking resolution with XXXX. BOA had more than sufficient documentation to begin the claim process at that time. Penalizing us for following your agents advice and exhausting all avenues with XXXX is unjust. 

To clarify, during the span of this dispute, we incurred {$14000.00} in payments to XXXX. Despite this, we limited our claim to {$6000.00}, focusing only on the services we paid for but did not receive. Your denial of Claim # XXXX on XX/XX/year>, citing the merchant proving the validity of the transaction, is flawed. The validity of the transaction has never been in question. The issue is that services paid for were not rendered, which is the basis of our claim. The distinction is critical : the transaction occurred, but the services promised were never delivered. 

In closing, we demand resolution. Specifically, we request that BOA pay the remaining balance of our original claim, {$6000.00}. Additionally, we urge you to stop issuing generic responses and address the core issue of this dispute with transparency and fairness. Our paper trail and documentation substantiate our position, and we expect BOA to act with integrity and accountability. 

Please ensure that this matter is addressed promptly and thoroughly. We will escalate our complaint further if necessary, as we are committed to seeking justice. 

We also demand any further communication be directed by a Supervisor of the Regulatory department. We have loss faith with the many claims that have been handle by agents, We demand a Supervisor call and/or respond to this complaint. Nothing less will be accepted.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",SC,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,12/16/24,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11170018.0

I did recently purchase XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX shoes for my son, which he paid for, I deposited money ( which there is proof of ) and shortly after depositing I ordered his shoes for school!

Im just absolutely disgusted by this entire process..I have XXXX children, Im a XXXX at a local restaurant, I decided to bank with chase because its very close to my new work and was convenient for me to do nightly cash deposits after workbut since this has happened, I transferred all but a small amount to my old bank, whom I never had not one issue with in 4 years of being a customerTwo weeks with chase and theres fraudulent activity and then this?

Neither party was able to articulate which transactions led to the {$9.00} charge. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted BMO again. BMO said a supervisor will call me to explain the charge. I waited. No one called. 

To prevent debt, I logged in to ensure my automatic payment is working. However, upon log-in, I received conflicting messages. The page went from you will not be charged, to no automatic payment will be processed, to 500 Internal Server Error, to a BMO homepage with no access to any credit card accounts given their closed status. 

I continued to wait for the supervisor 's call but received no callback to this day. 

On XXXX, while still waiting for the {$9.00} to be explained and the system giving conflicting messages about payment not being processed, I was charged not one, but two {$9.00} fees, and an interest adjustment fee of {$1.00}, totaling {$20.00}. 

On XXXX, I called to inquire about the fees. I was again provided with a vague statement related to rewards, and BMO is "" not able to tell you about the transaction ''. 

Afterward, I was pressured to pay the {$20.00} without a clear explanation of what led to the initial {$9.00} charge. 

The call dropped before the issue could be resolved.

As of XX/XX/2023 my credit score has dropped from a XXXX to a XXXX just like that. In my Equifax account it stated my credit score dropped XXXX points, but in actuality it dropped XXXX points. I called Equifax and they said a bank reported a overdraft. I explained to Equifax that I never received any information from that bank ( which I never really use about an over draft ). Me purchasing gas 5 months ago should not cause my credit score to drop dramatically. I explained that Equifax math is off because XXXX, therefore my credit score drop is by 68 points. I paid the bank it's XXXX and today I look at my credit score it dropped from XXXX to XXXX after I placed another dispute and voiced my complaint. This drop is another XXXX points. I need help fixing this issue. Equifax is stating it is not them and I believe it is. This situation is negatively affecting things I am trying to do. Equifax admitted in XXXX of 2023 to errors in their credit reporting and this is when my issue started. I want my credit score put back to a XXXX and my positive credit added to that XXXX, which will raise my credit score to where it should be. I worked hard on achieving a high credit score and want my credit score restored to it's accuracy XXXX points from XX/XX/2023.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MD,20785,,Consent provided,Web,08/22/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7439480.0

12-11-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"In XX/XX/year> my husband and I were traveling for almost a month through XXXX hitting multiple major cities in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Part of this trip was by land and part via a cruise. 

Upon arriving in XXXX we attempted to book train tickets to XXXX to reach as a stopover to XXXX. 

When attempting to purchase we never hit submit or anything on the site but were still charged and never received our tickets. 

Worried we got scammed we contacted Capital One to try to claw back the {$600.00} or so dollars we were charged for the XXXX tickets. 

We mentioned we were concerned we XXXX have encountered fraud and they now had our cc information. 

Without proper warning or talking us through any sort of process Capital One prematurely cancelled my credit card. This left my husband and I stranded without additional funds since we primarily use XXXX in the States but a lot of countries don't accept XXXX ( we use them for checking and for XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

They then offered to ship the new card to my location which wouldn't work because we were spending XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in each location until we hopped on a cruise ship. 

Fast forward to when we finally had our parents send us the new card details so we could use XXXX XXXX with the new card while still traveling Capital One decided to pause my account due to "" potential fraudulent activity. '' Their reasoning was since my account was closed and a new card issued they had to pause my account since there was spending on it ( mainly hotel and taxi costs ). However, I never heard back from their frud department on this "" case. '' Capital One was also knowledgeable about my travels as I had mentioned on every single call, with every single rep that we would be traveling for a month and even stated to which countries. 

I submitted documents to prove my identity while in XXXX and my account was supposedly "" lifted. '' When trying to pay for out hotel stay ( again because XXXX is not widely accepted ) my card was declined. 

When I called to ask why they said because the hotel was processing the payment as a cash advance and not a transaction and that the requested cash advance amount was over the limit my card allows. My husband on the other hand was able to process all hotel transactions just fine on either his XXXX or using his own lower-tier Capital One card and never had ANY of these issues. 

We were assured that when using the card for normal purchases and taxi 's it should work just fine. 

When we arrived in XXXX we went to make a purchase at a local antique dealer and again my card was declined. When I called this time they said my account was on hold yet again due to fraudulent activity. They requested even more information ( bank statements, utility bills, etc ) to prove my identity a second time. I was in XXXX so there way little I could do and since most bills are in my husband 's name this proved difficult. When explaining this I was offered an insincere apology and told unless provided my account would remain locked. 

This all took place in XX/XX/year>. It's not XX/XX/year> and I still do not have access to my account. Every document we send is not approved, they are unwilling to tell me why my account is suspended or what triggered so many locks on my account when my husband hasn't received XXXX despite having a lower-tier Capital One card he used the entire trip. Never once flagged for fraud. 

I find it to be extremely frustrating to have to continue to prove my identity despite supplying bank statements, account details, bills, my license, etc. I should be able to know exactly what triggered my account, why I'm being targeted etc before going through this nonsense, and be allowed to offer other ways to verify identity other than a utility bill like passport, social security card, etc that are LEGAL documents proving I am who I am. 

I am disgusted with Capital One and will never open another account with them Do not sign up for the XXXX XXXX  as it is NOT a travel card despite how they market it.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,33572,,Consent provided,Web,12-11-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11117710.0

On the evening of XX/XX/2025, I was targeted by a sophisticated scam that resulted in a fraudulent {$5900.00} USD transaction through my PayPal account. A scammer spoofed my banks caller ID, making it appear as a legitimate call from my bank, and claimed to be from their fraud protection team. They falsely stated that someone had taken a {$5900.00} loan in my name via PayPal and tricked me into protecting my funds by sending the money through PayPal, assuring me I wouldnt be held accountable. During the call, they phished my husbands bank login credentials, which they used to further deceive us. I the account holder, did not authorize this transaction my husband made the transfer under the scammers deception. We realized the scam shortly after and took immediate action : I pulled funds from our bank account to prevent the transfer, reported it to our banks fraud team, and filed a police report. The banks investigation verified suspicious activity related to the spoofed call and stolen credentials but ultimately closed their case, refusing to cover the loss. I also opened a fraud claim with PayPal the same day, explaining the situation. However, PayPal closed my claim within a week, stating that I still owe the {$5900.00} because it was an authorized transaction, despite it being under fraudulent pretenses. They have not allowed me to appeal through their app. On or around XX/XX/2025, PayPal sent a notice stating my account has a negative balance of {$5900.00} USD, which is now due, and provided a contact number ( XXXX ) .This transaction was not truly authorized I, the account holder, did not approve it, and it was only made because we were deceived by a scammer impersonating my bank.

However, a hiccup arose when a merchant I intended to spend approximately {$200.00} with experienced payment processing issues, resulting in a delayed charge that fell just beyond the 90-day window. Despite my efforts to rectify this with Chase, requesting an exception to include this charge in my spending total, I encountered resistance.

In XXXX, I applied for the XXXX XXXX Chase credit card through a flight attendant referral code and was approved for an opening bonus of XXXX miles. Shortly after my approval, this credit card product got "" upgraded '' to a new version by Chase Bank and the bank has been promoting it to the public with a debut offer of XXXX miles ( see attachment ). Around the same time, I received notification from Chase bank about my card has been automatically upgraded by the bank to this new version, with a significant increase on the card 's annual fee, raising it from {$95.00} to {$150.00} ( see attachment ). 

After a careful comparison, I realize that my XXXX XXXX card after this involuntary upgrade became exactly the same card as the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' card that is currently being promoted by Chase bank with a much higher opening bonus of XXXX miles ; and their annual fees are the same as well. It is absolutely not fair for certain customers to receive XXXX fewer miles at the same annual cost for the same credit card product. 

I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider matching your current promotion - an open bonus of XXXX miles, for my card. Such a gesture would ensure my satisfaction and encourage my future enrollment as a Chase Private Client.

09/28/23,Credit card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"I purchased furniture from Ashley furniture store in XXXX of XXXX for {$4200.00}. The XXXX and XXXX at the time convinced me to purchase the furniture by taking out a line of credit with 0 % apr which was on promotion from Synchrony. I informed them several times I did not want a credit card, and was assured that this was not a credit card. I signed the paper work for this promotion, and a few weeks later I received a credit card in the mail... I was angry, but it was not worth fighting at the time, given it was still 0 % interest. 

2.5 years later, On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked at my account expecting to see that I owed less than {$1000.00}. What I found instead was that my balance was {$4000.00} with {$3100.00} payed in interest! According to them, they had deferred all my payments to interest and said that I was notified via my statements. For 2.5 years I payed my bill with autopay setup, which they apparently set for less money than what was required to meet their requirements for deferred interest. Its a scam, and they used deceitful and confusing tactics. The last 6 months I payed {$900.00} with XXXX going straight to interest! And I was unaware! 

My receipt first page states that I signed up for synchrony XXXX XXXX XXXX payments, which I assume mean XXXX XXXX XXXX  payments, however that is not what I got. My first few statements were steady, then drastically dropped off each month. Again, another tactic to make me miss the XXXX XXXX mark ( which I was unaware of ). On the second page of my receipt, the salesman wrote that I had Synchrony for 12 months. I think he got lost in his own deceit. To further add to this deceit, I have no documentation of the "" loan '' /credit card itself. Nothing explaining this apparent XXXX XXXX deferred interest promotion. My account on the Synchrony website also has no documentation or explanation of the terms of this account. With no available documentation, how can this be legal!?!?! 

I spoke to countless Synchrony customer support specialists, and worked my way to the final person. Explaining the situation to each one. Each and everyone said I was wrong, and owed them the money regardless of what I was told. They said all that mattered was what I signed and I owed them an additional {$4000.00} regardless of what I said or who I talked to. 

I immediately paid the balance to prevent any further interest charges, but still feel like I am owed all of that interest back, {$3100.00}!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,CT,064XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/28/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7625658.0

The company website says guaranteed to ship in 7days but the couch didn't arrive until XX/XX/24. When the product arrived one of the pieces of couch was missing and they shipped a wrong item instead of it. I took pictures and immediately emailed the evidence to the company. I signed the BOL that the delivery team presented on their device which showed missing item. I rejected the wrong piece. I wasn't given the opportunity to selected the options on that device. ( This added info is missing from BOL that merchant provided to the bank ) I requested the company a expedited replacement for the missing piece but the company couldn't deliver it within a reasonable amount of time. So, I requested a full return and refund after the merchandise gets picked-up for which the company started to threaten me and said they will charge me for shipping costs and sue me if they find anything negative about the transaction on social media. They presented the condition of my silence on social media in exchange for a full return and refund. This evidence is in the email i submitted to CHASE bank and I uploaded it here also. 

I disputed the charge on my credit card with CHASE on XX/XX/24 and provided mountain of evidence pictures and email correspondence. 
The merchant later on XX/XX/24 after I submitted the dispute sent return labels but will not address my concern about refunding original shipping costs in the scenario that the items shipped were incorrect.

During the robbery, the perpetrator illicitly conducted bank transfers from my personal phone using the Chase app. 

Despite providing Chase Bank with extensive evidence, including official documents related to the case, they have refused to refund my money. 

Chase Bank 's reasoning for denying my claim is based on the fact that the transfers were authorized using Face ID. However, I was unconscious at the time, rendering their argument baseless and absurd. 

Regrettably, I find myself in a situation where Chase has declined to refund the funds that were fraudulently taken from my account. Despite exhausting all avenues within the fraud department and other conventional channels, including numerous hours spent on calls, my efforts have proved fruitless. 

The unauthorized transactions in question involve XXXX XXXX transfers made on XX/XX/2023, totaling {$4300.00}. These transfers comprised three charges from my personal account and XXXX from my business account. I have attached copies of the charges for your reference. 

Chase 's reasoning for refusing the refund is perplexing. They contend that, as the transfers were conducted via XXXX and authenticated with Face ID, they are absolved from responsibility.

I have called on multiple occasions to authorize the payment. I'm told it is rectified to then find out within a month or so it happens again. My card gets locked, I have to call each time and deal with this nonsense.

Approximately XX/XX/year>, the day my first granddaughter came home, I had 2 guys walking around my front yard.

What is stemming this complaint is I'm tired of having to pay the NSF fee when it is Prospers system. So I called and asked them to credit my account the {$25.00} as I do not think it is fair for me to suffer the fee when this continues to be a Prosper problem. 

I was informed today by XXXX, a supervisor at Prosper, said there is absolutely nothing I can do. I asked who I could speak with, she said no one.

I was clearly told by their representative that I could cancel the entire package ( hotel and flight ) within XXXX hours without penalty. Due to an urgent immigration concern, I attempted to canceled the package on XX/XX/year>, approximately XXXX hours later. 

Sensing from the Priceline representative that there might be an issue with honoring the cancellation, I immediately called Barclaysthe issuer of my credit cardto warn them that the upcoming charge from Priceline was unauthorized. At that time, the charge had not yet posted to my account. I specifically requested that the transaction be flagged and that my account be closed to prevent further unauthorized activity. 

Despite this proactive and timely effort, Barclays allowed the charge to post. I later filed a formal dispute, but they only temporarily and partially refunded the amount. I have since received conflicting responses from Priceline about the hotel portion being non-refundablecontrary to the terms I was promised. 

I previously filed a complaint with the CFPB, but it was closed with a conclusion that I had not provided enough proof. I am now re-filing this complaint because : I was never given a chance to explain that the cancellation was made by phone, so I never received a written confirmation. 

I acted in good faith to cancel and dispute the charge before it was posted. 

I closed my account specifically to protect myself, and yet the charge was still processed. 

Barclays failed to protect me as a consumer. I am asking CFPB to reopen or reconsider this case, and to hold Barclays accountable for not blocking an unauthorized transaction, despite timely notice.

No one told me this bank card is firewalled off XXXX and prohibited from contacting my bank account associated with my XXXX debit card account. I have followed every procedure, nothing is mysterious about this failed transaction but US Bank is dragging their heels in reversing the refused transaction. 

I have done the tracing number routine w/ both parties. XXXX has never seen the money on their money transfer docket. I certainly never saw a cent from this attempted transaction. The money went exactly nowhere. There is no compelling reason why US Bank can not just reclaim my {$970.00} as I began the transfer on a Monday morning, XX/XX/XXXX and here it is 28 days later on a Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and US Bank has not reinstalled my missing {$970.00} This is completely unacceptable!

No one will call or inform anything about it, but if there is an issue they will correct the transactions. They said there is no manipulation. They give excuses like the vendor will be charging fees or something so it is more. Nothing is true. 

The XXXX charged at the vendor is EUR XXXX which shows pending charge of {$3.00} and then adjusted after processing to {$3.00} So, initial currency conversion rate is {$1.00} = XXXX and then after processing it is {$1.00} = XXXX The currency conversion on XXXX is XXXX {$1.00} = XXXX At the same time of discover card transaction, we have another card transaction with visa from Bank of XXXX XXXX 
They have a foreign transaction fee, but they do not manipulate conversion rate or show a different charge as pending and after processing. 

The charge of EUR XXXX is shown as {$3.00} ( which is a conversion rate of {$1.00} = XXXX After processing the charge is still {$3.00} and a transaction fee added ( which they advertise, so not an issue ). 

Discover card ( now part of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) does currency manipulation and mask transaction fees. 

The total charges for discover card were {$91.00} XXXX XXXX card charges were {$39.00} The amount is not the issue. But the mal practice, currency manipulation, and putting blame on vendor is the issue.

At this point, I emailed the vendor to cancel the order. The vendor refused to cancel the order saying there is no cancellation policy.

I am writing to formally dispute several violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), and Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ). The inaccuracies and unauthorized actions of the involved creditors have had a profound impact on my life, causing undue stress, emotional turmoil, and unjust financial consequences. 

I want to share a personal story that vividly illustrates how these violations have affected me. Over the past year, I have been tirelessly working towards securing a mortgage for my dream home. As a hardworking individual, I meticulously managed my finances, always making timely payments and ensuring my credit history remained impeccable. However, my dreams were shattered when I discovered that certain creditors had reported inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. 

One particular instance that deeply resonates with me pertains to an account with the creditor XXXX, account number XXXX. Under the protection of the FCBA, I found it disheartening to learn that they inaccurately reported late payments, tarnishing my otherwise impeccable payment history. This erroneous reporting has unjustly diminished my credit score and has put my dream of homeownership in jeopardy. It is deeply distressing to realize that despite my efforts to maintain financial responsibility, I find myself facing these unwarranted challenges due to the creditors ' negligence. 

Furthermore, the unauthorized inquiries made by various creditors, including XXXX ( account number XXXX ), XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX/XXXX, have cast doubts on my financial credibility and have made it substantially more challenging to secure favorable terms for my mortgage application. These unauthorized inquiries represent a clear violation of the FCRA, a law designed to safeguard consumers ' privacy and control over their credit information. 

In light of the aforementioned violations, I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's intervention to ensure the enforcement of my legal rights and protection under the applicable laws. I implore your assistance in urging the involved creditors to promptly and thoroughly investigate the discrepancies and inaccuracies reported on my credit profile. Specifically, I ask that they verify and validate the accounts mentioned in this dispute, and subsequently, remove any unverified or inaccurately reported information from my credit report. 

I firmly believe that these actions will not only rectify the injustices I have faced but also restore my faith in the credit reporting system. My aspiration for a stable financial future and the ability to provide a comfortable home for my family hinge on the resolution of these matters. With your intervention, I am hopeful that the errors can be rectified, allowing me to pursue my dreams and aspirations with renewed vigor. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to upholding consumer rights and ensuring fair treatment in the financial sector. I eagerly await your response and look forward to a positive resolution that will pave the way for a brighter and more secure financial future.

For a period of eight years prior to this transition, I was a responsible and compliant account holder with XXXX XXXX. However, during the course of the transition to Goldman Sachs, which lasted approximately 3-4 months, I encountered significant and unexpected difficulties. 

Access to XXXX XXXXXXXX Account : Throughout the transition period, I was unable to access my XXXX XXXXXXXX account. This prevented me from viewing my balance, paying my bills, or managing any other account-related matters. 

Failure to Receive New Card : Despite diligent communication with Goldman Sachs ' customer support, I did not receive my new card. The support staff repeatedly assured me that the card was on its way, only to later discover that it had been sent to an outdated address. 

Delays in Addressing the Issue : The eventual realization of the mistake by Goldman Sachs led to further delays. The process of receiving my new card and accessing the newly switched Marcus account was fraught with unnecessary challenges. 

Credit Report Impact : During this period, I received a credit report indicating serious delinquency on this credit card account. This was alarming, given my otherwise perfect payment record on this and all other credit cards under my name. Though I promptly paid the outstanding {$30.00} balance upon finally gaining access to my account, the delinquency had already been recorded on my report. 

Impact on Mortgage Application : This erroneous delinquency has had a direct and adverse impact on my attempt to purchase a house, as it reflects unfairly on my creditworthiness. 

Unsuccessful Attempts at Resolution : Despite my best efforts to reach out to the concerned parties and seek resolution, I have been met with resistance and inaction. 

In light of the foregoing, I respectfully request your intervention and assistance in resolving this matter. I believe that the facts clearly demonstrate that I am a responsible consumer who pays debts in a timely manner, and that this incident is an aberration resulting from circumstances beyond my control. 

Your prompt attention to this matter will not only correct an injustice but also facilitate my ongoing efforts to purchase a home. Please find enclosed relevant documents supporting my case. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

XXXX. Upon maturity, the aforementioned CD was rolled over into a subsequent account. This account yielded a lower interest rate. The beneficiary designations remained the same with myself as POA/POD and my brother as co-POD. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, acting as POA for my mother, I met with a Wells Fargo banker determining it was financially prudent to incure the {$640.00} penalty to close the lower-yield account and establish a new 6-month CD with higher interest rate under the same beneficiary designations. Regrettably, I did not observe at the time of opening that new account that the banker had incorrectly titled the new CD, omitting the POA/POD designation. 
XXXX. My mother passed away on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX 
XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX my brother and I met with a representative at Wells Fargo to close several of my mother 's accounts. The other accounts were labeled corretly.

The Death Certificate was also scanned into their system at this time. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my brother and I met with another Wells Fargo banker bringing in the letter of Peronal Representative and we were not able to access the funds until an EIN account was set up. This is incorrect because the CD should have been labeled as POD & should be readily available to my brother and myself without an EIN account. 
XXXX. XXXXXX/XX/XXXX Our lawyer reached dropped a letter in person at Wells Fargo explaining the mistake. XXXXXX/XX/XXXX our lawyer followed up and was refused any information on the case, being referred to Customer Service overseas.

On XX/XX/2023 I initiated a {$120.00} payout XXXX XXXX that had a displayed processing date of no later than XX/XX/XXXX ( the next business day ), which means the funds would have typically posted to my bank account by the XXXX. Upon checking my survey.com account and email I can see that not only was the payout not processed by that time, but has also not been processed at all as of the XXXX, which means that, at the earliest, the payout won't be sent to my bank account until next Tuesday! Because I am very familiar with the timing of the payouts from this source I had a delayed emergency payment to another account scheduled to not post until just after this payout posted, but that is not what happened since I haven't received any funds as of yet on time for this payout. I also had a payment scheduled from another which posted to the account on time as it should have because they appropriately processed it in a timely manner. Both payments would have posted at the same time if it wasn't for XXXX mishandled this.

About 3 months ago I wanted to put it into a debt management program ( XXXX XXXX ) to get interest rate down to pay it off. XXXX XXXX contacted them twice to send a proposal and they never responded to it. All the while I was still paying the $ XXXX to keep the account current. Due to problems with XXXX the account had a late payment of a matter of days and XXXX charged a late fee of {$39.00}. Since XXXX  really had no interest in working with me or XXXX XXXX I requested XXXX XXXX forget about it and I would just continue to pay $ XXXX. To make a long story short XXXX charged me another {$39.00}. I set up autopay for XXXX and requested that they pull $ XXXX. However, because of the late fees I had a payment due of {$160.00} ( which was totally erroneous ), they were supposed to pull a payment of {$35.00} of XX/XX/XXXX and instead pulled the {$160.00}. I called my bank to stop payment on the {$160.00}. They have tried to do this but because the payment hasn't posted yet they are unable to do it until it posts. I called XXXX XXXX and got them to drop the late fees after I informed them that late fees have been capped to {$8.00} for each transaction.

We are XXXX  year customers and have deposited checks from this same issuer before including XXXX just last week with no hold applied. We deposit checks frequently via mobile for our business, and we have no history of overdrafts or returned items.

The only help offered was to file a complaint with a XXXX wait for any possible resolution while we are left with XXXX money to pay rent, buy food, or cover bills. 

This is not a procedural issue this is a human hardship that U.S. Bank is actively worsening. XXXX 100 % of a check without release of even a portion during urgent financial need is excessive and punitive.

This entire process has been extraordinarily frustrating, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the lack of urgency, clear communication, and follow-through from your customer service team. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I closed my Chase Sapphire credit card account and discovered a credit balance of {$880.00}. I contacted your customer service department multiple times in XX/XX/XXXX to request the refund. After several phone calls, I was emailed a transfer request form to have the funds refunded to my checking account. I completed and submitted this form on XX/XX/XXXX, and the request was processed on the same day. 

However, after XXXX days, I noticed no refund had been credited to my checking account. I followed up with customer service, and while the representative assured me the refund request had been processed, I was informed that the only solution was to issue a physical check. I was told this check would be mailed to me in XXXX business days. 

I waited patiently for the check, but by the second week of XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received it. When I called customer service again, I was told the check had already been mailed and was asked to continue waiting until XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, I began to feel like my issue was being ignored. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called once more, and I still had not received the check. I have verified my mailing address several times and confirmed there are no issues receiving mail. Despite this, I was told to continue waiting. I then requested that the check be sent via XXXX, offering to pay for the expedited service, so I could track its delivery. The representative refused to accommodate my request and stated that a new check could be issued, but I would have to wait another XXXX business days until XX/XX/XXXX. 

This delay, lack of communication, and refusal to take appropriate action is completely unacceptable. Chase Sapphires inability to address my refund request in a timely manner and the failure to acknowledge the urgency of my situation reflect poorly on your customer service and your commitment to customers. 

To resolve this issue, I demand the following : Immediate processing of my refund with proof of processing. 
If the refund is to be mailed, it must be sent via certified mail or XXXX to ensure I can track its delivery. 
A detailed explanation as to why my refund has been delayed for this extended period, and what steps Chase Sapphire is taking to ensure that I can get my refund back.

During the call, the Wells Fargo impersonator obtained my log-in credentials and used those to 1 ) attempt a wire transfer and 2 ) take cash advances/make charges totaling {$7300.00} on two credit cards associated with my small business account. During the call I noticed strange comments, so I hung up, and called Wells Fargo to report the incident. Wells Fargo immediately stopped the wire transfer and issued a {$2500.00} credit to the small business credit cards ; however, I dispute the full amount of {$7300.00}. Wells Fargo denied my claim on XXXX/XXXX/2023, and since that time, I have repeatedly and consistently requested help through the XXXX Assistance XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX. My request is that the XXXX investigator re-open and review the full case, and the facts will clearly show that all charges on the cards since XX/XX/2023 are related to the same fraud incident. Unfortunately, since XXXX/XXXX/2023, Wells Fargo has been unwilling and unable to respond to my requests. Each time I call the XXXX Assistance XXXX and present my case number, I reach a new customer service representative who is unable to contact the XXXX investigator directly. I have attempted to submit supporting documents by fax ( XX/XX/2023 ) and email ( XX/XX/2023 ). As of this writing, Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX can not confirm whether the XXXX investigator has received or reviewed these documents. During my XX/XX/2023 phone call to the XXXX Assistance XXXX, the customer service representative advised that he would create escalations claim and submit on my behalf.

I also called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to see if they couldn't credit back the fraudulent fee. They advised me that they could do nothing and I had to go through my XXXX XXXX. They needed to issue a charge back. 

I contacted XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX with the updated XXXX explanation and wanting to understand how this fraud happened. They assured me they would address the issue. 

XX/XX/XXXX - contacted XXXX XXXX again, because they did not resolve the {$5100.00}. They promised to resolve the transaction again and placed a provisional credit on our CC. 

Elan mailed a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX reversing the provisional credit. They stated that we authorized the transaction, and received the benefit from the transaction. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I spoke with Elan again and explained to them that this was wrong. Well, XXXX maintained it was valid so there's NOTHING they could do. I asked for the documents that prove this is a valid purchase. They said they would mail them to me. I asked that they have someone in Management contact me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX me. Again, I informed them that this charge was not authorized by my husband or I. She said the case was closed and there was nothing she could do and suggested I contact XXXX for the credit. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I contacted XXXX again and they claim that they have no method of issuing a credit and it has to come in the form of a charge back. During the course of this long conversation, they did acknowledge that it was a fraudulent purchase. I asked for a document to be sent to be acknowledging the fraud. They agreed to mail it to me, but I did not receive it. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I contacted Elan again to tell them XXXX acknowledged the fraud and this needs to be reopened. After begging them, they agreed to have another XXXX contact me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Elan/US Bank XXXX XXXX ) contacted me and said the case was closed and there was nothing else XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX We needed to pay the charge. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Mailed a certified XXXX Dispute form to XXXX, UT. I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX. Again, they acknowledged it was fraudulent and escalated the claim. They advised me again that there was no way for them to refund me and that it had to come through as a charge back and that they would not dispute it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter to XXXX XXXX, XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX. The credit union promoted the Elan credit card and explained the awful experience customer service support I was receiving from they company they partnered with. I am a longtime customer of this credit union. He assigned the issue to XXXX - XXXX of Credit Card Services. 

She attempted to get this escalated and have a "" real '' XXXX from XXXX to contact me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - A man named XXXX called from Elan. He worked in the XXXX of the XXXX. I asked what the XXXX 's name was? He didn't know, and would have to look it up, which he did. His title was XXXX Response XXXX. He wasn't a supervisor, XXXX, vice president, XXXX, etc. He told me there was nothing more that could be done and that I would have to file for arbitration. He would be mailing the information on how to proceed with arbitration. He didn't care that XXXX acknowledges it's fraudulent and it needs to be charged back. They WILL NOT contest it. He didn't care that we don't own an IPhone, which was the device used to purchase tickets to a XXXX XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. He also didn't care that the IP address used was not our XXXX address. He would not issue a charge back. He informed me that I was assigned case # XXXX. 

I relayed this information to XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am beyond outraged that the hours I have spent on a fraudulent transaction to our credit card and now I am being told I have to go to arbitration for a fraudulent claim. I have now incurred {$110.00} in finance charges, since I will not pay for a fraudulent charge. It also will be affecting my XXXX XXXX. I asked for another provisional credit while this is still "" in my mind '' being disputed, but it was denied. 

I just can not believe that a large corporation is allowed to resolve customer services issues like this. My husband and I are Senior citizens ( XXXX and XXXX ) old. We live on a fixed income. My husband is XXXX and it would have been impossible for him to attend a fight at the XXXX XXXX. They should be ashamed of their actions and how they have addressed this issue.

06/19/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Wells Fargo has allowed unauthorized users to access my bank account three times in the last 6 months -- XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. It appears their security verification for changing online banking passwords is not strong enough -- seems like you only need a phone number or email, or if you have the last four digits of the SSN you can change it, and those are easily found on the dark web. When this happened in XXXX, I asked the bank to open an investigation and they found that one of their customer service agents failed to recognize that someone was impersonating me and had called asking to change the phone number associated with my bank account, so they were able to set it to their phone number, change the password, and withdraw funds. The investigator told me that the customer service representatives didn't catch the fraud because the person calling "" sounded confident, '' which was not an indication that anything was wrong. I pointed out that people committing fraud are often professionals and very good at coming across in a certain way, so their security should be more than what appears to be them just checking out the vibes of the person calling. 

Wells Fargo also represented to me that their would be additional fraud alerts placed on my account after the XXXX incident. However, if they did anything like that, it didn't work because my account has now been compromised again. This time, someone was able to change my password without my authorization, and then they granted themselves guest access to my online banking. The hacker was able to transfer {$2500.00} before Wells Fargo 's fraud system caught on and alerted me. It also allowed some of the transactions to go through ; only one was caught and frozen. The hacker overdrew my bank account, so Wells Fargo allowed the {$2500.00} transaction to go through. The hacker also used XXXX to transfer {$950.00} after adding a new recipient. This was not picked up by fraud detection either, even though I had never sent money to this recipient before. There should be some kind of multi-factor authorization or other security measure for adding or sending funds to a new phone number. Wells Fargo did freeze an attempted {$45.00} transfer, but the other money had already been taken. I'm attaching to this complaint emails that I received that indicated that the fraud was occurring. I don't know the people or phone numbers who are listed as recipients in the emails. 

I have been very careful with my online password -- it is not saved in my browser nor is it a password I use anywhere else. I have done scans of my devices for keystroke tracking and have not found anything. I often use my work computer to log in, using XXXX mode, and I work around sensitive information so the security on the work devices is very high. The problem seems to be with Wells Fargo not having effective security.

09/14/24,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Managing an account,Problem with fees or penalties,"I had a CD account that matured on XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed to be closed and transferred to my Marcus XXXX. I checked my account on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX  and my CD was not closed, the money was not transferred, yet it said the maturity date was XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I immediately called them and turns out that back in XXXX, I had taken out a chunk of money to put into a XXXX  XXXX CD from my XXXX and they had put a hold on my account. I did NOT receive ANY notification or alerts that I had this hold so because I had this hold, they could not close my CD and transfer it to my XXXX. So then after being transferred between 3 different representatives, confirming my identity every single time, then hanging up and waiting for them to call me, only for my phone to block all unknown numbers, me calling them back, and them finally calling me back again, they told me that the hold was cancelled and my CD will be transferred to my XXXX within 1-3 business days! 

This was my first time calling them for support so I tried be patient and wait, but still nothing was updated on my account. I had to wait until after XXXX XXXX to call them again on XX/XX/XXXX in which I had to do the whole process of explaining all over again and they told me the TRANSFER WAS NEVER PROCESSED. This was the first red flag of so many more to come. How can you not finish processing what your customer has requested?! So NOW they tell me that my CD was marked as a new CD account so transferring money out of the CD into my XXXX will result in a withdrawal fee. I was not having it and said that can NOT happen. The representative said, "" I'll talk to the agents and SEE what we can do '' I responded, "" No, you will not 'see ', you MUST remove the withdrawal fee for something that I did not do! '' They said they will put this into a case to get it approved to remove the withdrawal fee and again, they told me it will take 1-3 business days to transfer and I was getting pretty frustrated, but what can I do except wait? I don't usually get angry or aggressive with these phone calls. I try to be understanding so I said I'll wait. 

Now comes this past week, XXXX XXXX, STILL my CD is just sitting there I can not access my money and nothing has happened. I call them for the THIRD TIME and again, I am told that they never processed the case to get my withdrawal fee waived so the money from the CD can be transferred out. At this point I just lost it and told them this is trash customer service and I deserve a compensation. To her credit, this representative was the most understanding and nicest out of everyone and she put in another case number for me to get the withdrawal fee waived as well as a good will credit of {$25.00} to compensate all the headache and frustrations of this, which is better than nothing, but definitely not worth all the time I had to put into getting this resolved. She also told me that the the money in the CD is still accruing interest even though the account matured already ... we'll see if that's actually the case. So she gives me two case numbers and said it ll take another 1-3 business days. so once again, i'm left to just waiting. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I call again because I can't imagine what the hold up is. This time, as soon as I share all of the past 3 weeks of frustration and lay out exactly what has happened and what has been communicated to me, the representative says, actually there is no timeline and they were never supposed to tell you it will take 1-3 business days. I truly lost it and for the first time demanded to speak to her manager. She transferred me to her supervisor who was very sassy and sarcastic and was not helpful at all. i explained everything and she just kept repeating over and over again that I will get a call when it's resolved, but THERE WAS NO TIMELINE OF WHEN. When I pointed it out to er that this means I am indefinitely waiting to access money that is rightfully mine with no projection of when it would be, all she responded back with was, they will call you when it's approved. I was furious and said this customer service is completely useless and I expect some form of compensation for all of this. She said we can't do that, but can file a complaint for me. I asked her what the complaint will do and all she said was, it will just be on file ... again completely useless to what I'm dealing with now. So I gave her feedback right then and there and said this is completely unacceptable and ridiculous and I will be closing my account as soon as I have access to my money. I asked her for the case number again and she was like, "" Oh I didn't think you'll need it b/c you're closing your account '' Uh no, I'm not closing anything until I get this resolved with no penalty fee. And at that point, there was nothing else more I could say to her and I just hung up. But this has been t most frustrating three weeks ever and I am baffled by how terrible of a customer service they have.

I asked for a provisional credit, and they mentioned that could take up to XXXX days. After two weeks, and calling in multiple times for an update I was told later that the claim had been closed 2 days after the claim had been opened. I asked why it was that I didn't get any notification that the claim had reached a resolution?

In which I responded with the fact that's how I have been notified in the past with two other claims. 

This conversation with the claims manager ranged from explaining all of my interactions with the machine, and to understanding how the machines perform, and correspond with the server, or in other words, what kind of pings get created within that process. In which I learned that there are such things as "" XXXX '' pings that are associated with every interaction with the machine. Thus my response, that their statemen that there was no evidence that I interacted with that machine is inconsistent with there statement about how the machine sends that relay information in pings to the server. And to top off the fact that they hadn't checked any cameras, was also included in their response by default as I offered the question about if that had been checked or not? 

There were forms of retaliation that followed in including deposits being denied, or stopped after the claim was opened, and through multiple atm 's I wasn't able to make deposits, which further pushed back my late payments that I was trying to pay for with the original deposit. 

These forms of communication or lack of were outside the time frames of operating a claim in accordance to the OCC.

The following is a letter I wrote and follow up details to date as the problem is still not resolved. 


CitiBank XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXXXXXX XX/XX/XXXX RE : Fraudulent Charges Made against XXXX ( Previously Acct : XXXX ) Dear Citibank, Consider this my Affidavit regarding the details of the above matter. 
I have been a victim of identity theft, this fact is on file with all credit bureaus, the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX police, the Federal Trade Commission and XX/XX/XXXX 

The Citibank card noted above was issued as a replacement for card XXXX. The replacement card is in my possession and has never been activated by me or my spouse. There should be no way to use this card as the new account number is only known by me and Citibank. 

Unfortunately, somehow, this card was used to make many unauthorized charges recently even though it was never activated. The charges amount to approximately {$27000.00}, {$9800.00} of the total were processed. I/We never made or authorized any of these charges as the card has not been activated by me, the account owner. 

I contacted CitiBank immediately upon receiving a letter alerting me of fraudulent activity. I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX reviewed the charges with me and confirmed that all of the charges that were made to the UNACTIVATED Card were in fact not made my me and were fraudulent. 

XXXX then reviewed my profile and found that this account had been modified to add a fake authorized user. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX who has a cell phone XXXX, further there was an address added to the account :XX/XX/XXXXXXXX and a fake XXXX mail XXXX I requested that Citibank removeXX/XX/XXXXas I do not know him and never authorized him to have access to my account. 

All of the above information is NOT ASSOCIATED with me and should be investigated as this person is committing crimes against CitiBank and its customer. 

I asked XXXX to permanently close accountXX/XX/XXXX and to NOT open a replacement account and NOT send me any new cards. 

I asked XXXX to update my account by updating all information in the system to the below correct information : Email :XX/XX/XXXXPhone XX/XX/XXXXAddress : XX/XX/XXXX These charges to the un-activated account in my name have been reported to the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Police. 

I have also reported this activity to the Federal Trade Commission and am keeping my case updated. 

The following is a detailed timeline : XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from Citibank regarding suspicious activity associated with my account. ( Letter enclosed Reference Number XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX We called to report fraudulent charges noted above and spoke to XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reviewed the charges and asked if any of them were made or authorized by me. I responded No I did not make or authorize any of these charges. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked How is it possible that a card that has not been activated is able to be used?. XXXX politely said that he did not know how this could happen. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked, If this new card was issued to me, and I and Citibank are the only ones who know the account number. How could someone else use the number to make changes to the account by adding themselves as an authorized user and then begin using the card number to purchase things up to XXXX?. XXXX politely said that he did not know how this could happen. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked how the account credit limit was increased from XXXX to at least XXXX without my approval as I did not make this request? ( Previous account XXXX had a limit of XXXX, XXXX was charged ) XXXX politely said that he did not know how this could happen. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX indicated that he marked ALL of the charges to account XXXX as Fraudulent. 

XX/XX/XXXX Per my request XXXX told me that he permanently cancelled account XXXX and promised not to set up a replacement account or issue any new cards. 

XX/XX/XXXX I then asked XXXX to send me via mail a written record of the call which he never did. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX confirmed that the charges would be removed from the account and that the account was permanently closed. XXXX also checked using my SSN to ensure that no other accounts with CitiBank were open associated with my SSN. 

XX/XX/XXXX I told XXXX that I has not yet received a bill from the original account and was concerned about making my payment. He said that while the original account is being reviewed no bill will be issued and late fees will not be applied because of the ongoing investigation of account No. XXXX. 

I am writing this affidavit to assist in this investigation by stating that the charges made on my card are fraudulent and I am sure that if you check locations phone numbers and shipping destinations you will find that none of them correspond to me or my spouse. 

Please remove the above noted charges and respond in writing as to the status of this case to the following address : Our address is : XX/XX/XXXX Our Phone Numbers :XX/XX/XXXXPlease contact us regarding this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX Attached :XX/XX/XXXXXXXX Police Report, XXXXXX/XX/XXXX Police Report, Federal Trade Commission XXXX ; CitiBank Fraudulent Activity Letter Ref XXXX cc. : XX/XX/XXXXPolice Report XXXX, FTC Case XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Letter containing the above text was sent certified mail to CitiBank Today I called to check on the status of my case and found that not only nothing had been done BUT more charges were made, the disputed charges were confirmed as accurate by the fraudster XX/XX/XXXX as he and his information were not removed from my account! the account was NOT closed as promised and in fact, CitiBank was communicating with XXXX XXXX instead of me! 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank and talked to XXXX in their Fraud department and was told that all of the charges were approved by me during a call that I made on XX/XX/XXXX. I never made a call to Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I confirmed that the card that was to be closed on XX/XX/XXXX was never closed and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX in fact was contacted to authorize the fraudulent charges. Which he did. CitiBank never contacted me because XXXX never updated my personal information. They contacted the fraudster ( XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ). 

XX/XX/XXXX I indicated to XXXX that I felt that the fraud was occurring inside Citibank due to the access to the account numbers. She did not comment. I also stated that by continually not closing accounts and allowing unshared confidential numbers to be in the hands of people other than the account owner in my opinion is aiding and abetting a criminal. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked XXXX to update all of my personal information and remove XXXX XX/XX/XXXX from the account and to re-establish myXX/XX/XXXX She told me that she had done so. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked XXXX to close the account and she did but immediately another account was established by the system which she said could not be closed for 2 days. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked that XXXX remove all charges, she said that she could not, but she would mark them all as fraudulent. 

XX/XX/XXXX I asked that CitiBank confirm this interaction and the closure of the account via e mail or regular mail. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX said that she would call me in 2 days to confirm the closure of the account. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX said that a manager would call me to discuss the fraud on this account as it was too much for her to decide. 

I thanked XXXX for her help and ended the call. I await CitiBank phone calls confirming resolution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,05-09-2024,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,8972428.0

10/26/24,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Discovery of Account Theft Upon returning to the United States on XX/XX/year>, the plaintiff visited Wells Fargo on XX/XX/year>, to review their account status, only to find that their account had been compromised. The plaintiff filed a claim on XX/XX/year>. However, even after the claim was filed, the bank permitted fraudsters to change the account 's phone number and home address. Severely infringing upon the plaintiff 's financial security and privacy rights, in violation of California Civil Code 1798.81.5, which requires financial institutions to implement reasonable security measures. 
Unauthorized Activities While the plaintiff was abroad, Wells Fargo 's gross negligence enabled fraudsters to execute multiple unauthorized transactions : XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$10000.00} at the bank counter. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$10000.00} at the bank counter. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$8000.00} at the bank counter. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$6000.00} at the bank counter. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$600.00} at the bank counter. 
These incidents have been reported to the XXXX Police Department for investigation. Based on the claim report, it is believed that these activities occurred at the XXXX XXXX branch, and the bank 's headquarters is requested to verify this. The bank 's failure to verify the identities of those making these withdrawals violates California Financial Code 2101, which emphasizes the responsibility of financial institutions to ensure proper identification of account holders. 
Subsequent Losses Following the initial claim, Wells Fargo took no corrective action, leading to further unauthorized transactions : XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$400.00}. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent withdrawal of {$40.00}. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudulent deposit and withdrawal of {$1500.00}. 
XX/XX/year> : Unauthorized purchase of {$200.00}. 
XX/XX/year> : Fraudster used a fake credit card in the plaintiff 's name ( last XXXX digits XXXX ) to make a {$400.00} purchase. 
Fraudsters also opened multiple credit cards under the plaintiff 's name using forged identification, without the bank verifying the plaintiff 's identity, in violation of California Civil Code 3260. The last XXXX digits of these fraudulent credit cards are XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, From my records, I see that the criminals opened XXXX credit cards.while the plaintiff 's legitimate credit cards end in XXXX and XXXX. 
Additional Notes All other bank activities after XX/XX/year>, except the following two transactions, were perpetrated by criminals : XX/XX/year> : XXXX XXXX XXXX  deduction of {$130.00}. 
XX/XX/year> : XXXX XXXX XXXX  deduction of {$260.00}.

He has been very helpful and supportive in assisting with the resolution. However, when the claims were escalated to the Wells Fargo headquarters, the headquarters refused to take further action. 
Escalations Representative : XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX Fax : XXXX Key Issues : Multiple claims have been submitted, including those related to credit card fraud and unauthorized withdrawals, but Wells Fargo has failed to address them in a timely manner, leading to significant delays and a lack of resolution. 
On XX/XX/year>, the plaintiff visited the bank branch to address these issues. The branch manager, XXXX XXXX, provided great assistance and actively worked to resolve the claims. However, once the cases were forwarded to the banks headquarters, no further action was taken, and the cases stalled. 
The bank has been dismissive and unresponsive, and the plaintiff has struggled to get clear answers regarding the status of their claims. 
Calls to various departments often result in transfers that do not connect, and there are some missing claim numbers that the bank has yet to provide. 
The status of the credit card account remains unclear, raising concerns that unauthorized use may still be ongoing, as the bank has not taken definitive measures to prevent further unauthorized activity.

If paid off within certain time frames I can avoid finance charges. I'm very careful to make sure I am paying correctly to avoid these. In XXXX I had a promotional charge in the amount of {$3000.00} due, I discovered that Synchrony had misapplied my last three payments to random other promotions instead of this promotion. I requested the correct their mistake. Instead they reversed the payments an applied them to other promotions. Instead of continuing to argue with them about getting it paid I asked my husband for money to get it paid off. That would have left the next three promotional balances with something applied to them - this is where they misapplied. My XXXX promotion was paid off and according to my records that would have left my upcoming XXXX promotion with approximately {$300.00} dollar applied to it leaving me just over {$100.00} to pay by XX/XX/XXXX. I have a spreadsheet laying all of these payments out. Today I received an email telling me I owed almost the full balance of the XXXX promotion, {$410.00} due by the 3rd. When I logged onto my account I was expecting to see close to {$300.00} already applied to this promotion and there is only {$5.00} applied. So I contacted them requesting a full accounting from them of the payments received on my account for the past 12 months with the information as to what charges these payments were applied too. I was told to review my statements, the information was there. Its not, the statements show the payments received but not where they have been applied. According to my records there is close to {$300.00} unaccounted for- they didn't have it applied to what was due in XXXX, it was on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX- now that {$300.00} shows not on those promotional balances and it does not show the promotional balance from XXXX overpaid the {$300.00} - So where is the money? Somewhere in the past year something with how they are applying and accounting for my payments has been done incorrectly and they are missing {$300.00} from being applied to my promotional balances. My request for the accounting of the past 12 months showing payments and where they were applied was denied. They told me they can only tell me what payments were made in the past 60 days, nothing more. They have no system to tell me this. That makes me really highly concerned. I do bookkeeping and HR for a living and I have to keep all my records for years - you are telling me they don't? I just want an accounting of my records.

08/24/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"Complaint : Regardless of the amount of times Wells Fargo is fined and sued, they continue to deceive their account holders without even attempting to hide it. During this year, I have paid more than {$300.00} in erroneous overdraft fees that are charged to my account the next day, during the grace period that they continuously and falsely advertise. In the evidence that I am submitting, you can clearly see various examples of this, i.e. account is overdrawn on Day XXXX, the account balance is then made positive via deposit on Day XXXX, but on Day XXXX, an overdraft fee appears to have been posted on Day XXXX. I have gone to my local Wells Fargo a couple of times where the Manager lectured me on how to understand the way they structured their transactions to make it beneficial for them. The reality is that the manager told me that the Wells Fargo app was only for educational purposes, basically stating that you shouldnt believe what you see because it could not be true and that since this was a reoccurrence in my account it must be my fault. With her attitude, she essentially told me that if I werent poor and stored my money with Wells Fargo more often, I wouldnt have these issues. The worst part of everything is that even when Wells Fargo sees that they are in the wrong, they will tell you We are so sorry but since this is not the first Overdraft Fee we can't waive it despite the fact that the times they have only waived it when they recognize that they are at fault. Wells Fargo will never lose the argument ; they will tell you that X transaction was mysteriously started before I ( the customer ) could even see it, and that's the reason I accrued Overdraft Fees. Basically, if a bill is paid on the XXXX of each month and appears on my account on the XXXX WF will charge an overdraft fee if I dont pay it on the XXXX, despite that date being within their imaginary grace period because the transaction started on the XXXX, despite the fact that it was not reflected on my educational app on the XXXX. Wells Fargo offers bill pay services and autopay services but expects its customers to remember the exact day that the transaction is initiated. Wells Fargo hides information from its customers and they will always argue to favor them, leaving the customer with nothing to do. Wells Fargo is stealing from its customers and if you are a minority, you will be treated as if the only money you have is whatever they see in your account. I pay $ 10 monthly to Wells Fargo so I can store my money at their place and I expect Wells Fargo to honor their services and promises.

I had since then spoken to them many times and was told to again keep waiting for them to provide a resolution. Not only did US Bank never contact me, I ended up calling their fraud liasion center again in XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told the claim was rejected and if I wanted to get my money back, I had to go through a court. 

During that phone call, I also asked for details of the investigation and reason why they would not be able to reissue me a check and I have never received the requested information from US BANK. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I had a lawyer send a demand letter to US Bank but have not heard from them since then. My lawyer also reached out to the XXXX XXXX ( where the check was fraudulently cashed out ) and I have attached their response here. Based on their response, it was US bank 's responsibility for not being able to notify XXXX XXXX within the required 30 day window. In addition, it sounds like US Bank received the response from XXXX XXXX way earlier than what I was told. Again I am trying to resolve this issue without having to go through a court. So I need US Bank to respond with details of the investigation as well as reissue me a check with the amount plus loss of interest accured asap. 

Please find response from XXXX XXXX below : Pursuant to UCC 4-207 ( d ), a claimant must submit a claim to a warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and identity of the warrantor. Failure to meet this deadline results in the warrantor being discharged. 

In this case, XXXX XXXX notified US Bank at least by XX/XX/XXXX of the alleged forgery. See emails attached she sent US Bank affidavit. US Bank then had 30 days to make claim upon XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, or by XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, U.S. Bank did not send XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX any notice until a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX well outside the 30 day timeframe. Accordingly, per the attached emails, the claim was denied. 

Claimant ( s ) knew of the alleged breach at least by XX/XX/XXXX, but notification was not timely tendered to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As such, any liability the XXXX XXXX had in this matter has been extinguished pursusant to UCC 4-207 ( d ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,TX,77007,,Consent provided,Web,03/13/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8538785.0

Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the matter directly with Wells Fargo, I have encountered significant obstacles and remain unsatisfied with their response. 

On XX/XX/2024, I utilized Wells Fargo 's services to send a {$100.00} XXXX payment to a recipient who is registered with XXXX and is also a customer of Wells Fargo. The intended recipient 's details are as follows : Name : XXXX XXXX Phone Number : XXXX However, despite the deduction of funds from my account, the payment was never delivered to XXXX XXXX. Despite my efforts to seek clarification and resolution through multiple calls to Wells Fargo 's customer service, I have been met with evasive responses and a failure to address the issue effectively. 

According to Wells Fargo representatives, the failure to deliver the payment was attributed to a purported token issue within their system. Despite this acknowledgment, Wells Fargo has refused to accept responsibility for the failed transaction, claiming that it falls outside their jurisdiction. 

Not only has Wells Fargo failed to deliver the funds to the intended recipient, but they have also neglected to provide any information regarding the whereabouts of the money. Furthermore, despite my insistence, they have failed to initiate the refund process. 

I believe that, given Wells Fargo 's history and pattern of fraud, their handling of this matter constitutes a blatant act of fraudulent behavior and a violation of consumer rights. As such, I am seeking your intervention to ensure that Wells Fargo fulfills its obligations to deliver the funds to the intended recipient or issue a prompt refund. 

I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to hold Wells Fargo accountable for their actions. Additionally, I request that measures be implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to safeguard the rights of consumers. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Your office will take the necessary steps to address this complaint and ensure a satisfactory resolution.

I immediately contacted my bank who within a 3 hour time period confirmed that this was fraud, that I was not involved and refunded the missing money to my bank account. 

The guidance I received over these last 4 months has been frightening to say the least. One representative actually thought it would be a great idea if XXXX sent me the credit balance on my account ( due to the dispute credits ) and I could then pay one of the outstanding installment accounts on one of the fraudulent IPhone purchases ( there were XXXX phones purchased ).. I quickly dismissed this advice as being non-nonsensical which prompted me to ask for a supervisor to intercede. 

I have had some better advice and service from a few of the supervisors who promise to make it their personal mission to get this corrected once and for all. However, when they have cleared one case off the docket some XXXX puts it back on. 

I have specifically been irate that during these XXXX months, the purchases have been reported to the Credit Bureau which of course has had a negative impact on my credit rating. Debt to income way out of whack with just under {$9000.00} in fraudulent purchases. When I contacted customer service to express my frustration that obvious fraudulent purchases would be reported under my name. I received a nasty email in return stating that because the balances showed up on my billing statement they were correct in reporting the information. Totally dismissed the fact that this was fraud. Credit rating directly equates to the cost of money for me. I have had to delay the purchase of a new vehicle as I would be charged much higher interest rates that I would have afforded under my true rating.",,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,MN,557XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10-11-2023,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,7684385.0

The reason why Im writing is because I want to complain about when I call and talk to agents about my Discover credit card regarding the balance transfer what do I need to pay on top of the minimum payment to avoid interest they are not giving me the correct information. They are giving misleading, confusing and wrong information. Im really just calling to clarify to make sure so my payment I just made was {$150.00} the minimum payment {$130.00} plus {$20.00} of a purchase to avoid interest on this cycle of XXXX. I called to clarify one agent gave me the wrong information said I need to pay my full balance without paying attention to the details of my account so then I ask to speak to a supervisor told me that I needed to pay {$6000.00} and something but that is the balance transfer that is under no interest for a year with the promotion she also told me its hard to avoid interest on a credit card its always a chance you can get charged interest which that isnt true either. I got so frustrated I hung up the phone. I called back and requested to speak to a supervisor and she told me that in needed to pay the minimum payment plus the balance transfer fees and the transaction/purchases I made but I told her the fees were paid with the balance transfer which isnt due until a year from the balance transfer date to avoid interest. I believe the {$150.00} payment is correct but your agents and supervisors needs to be more aware of my questions and how balance transfer work with promotion plus transaction/purchases to avoid interest. I just wanted clarification and they confused the situation even though I believe I understand what Im doing and the very first agent that explained to me when I made my first payment of {$800.00} something right after the balance transfer explain to me correctly. The agents I spoke to that gave me different confusing information makes me not want to ever due the balance transfer again. I know my transactions/purchases have a promotion on the interest but I still want to avoid interest all together so I know I need to pay minimum payment plus anything purchases I made in that billing cycle and I just wanted to be reassured. Can you please clarify if Im doing it right and the payment I made for XXXX of {$150.00} is correct?

However, Capital One refused to reimburse me for these charges. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I reported to Capital One that my card was lost or stolen. Capital One assured me that the old credit card would no longer be valid and could not be used by anyone. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to the XXXX to cancel their services. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after noticing charges by the XXXX despite the cancellation ( I was out of the country until XX/XX/XXXX ), I disputed these charges XXXX times. I informed Capital One that the XXXX had used my lost credit card number to make these charges. Capital One assured me they had blocked the XXXX to prevent further charges. The transactions were as follows : ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, {$29.00} ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, {$69.00} ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, {$29.00} ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, {$69.00} Initially, Capital One credited back these charges, but later reversed all four transactions after receiving documents from the XXXX. 

Capital One provided me with the XXXX 's documents. I disputed the XXXX 's claim that cancellation had to be done via certified mail, as they attached a document stating this policy. However, this document was fabricated. The XXXX did not provide this cancellation policy, and there was no "" Accept '' button in any of their emails. Before purchasing their service, they had emailed me stating that I could cancel at any time if I was unsatisfied with their service. 

I uploaded my supporting documents to the platform provided by Capital One, highlighting the XXXX 's fabricated documents regarding the cancellation policy. 

Capital One denied my dispute against the XXXX and refused to reimburse the four charges. 

Even after these disputes, the XXXX charged me again on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$29.00} and {$69.00} ) and on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$410.00} and {$200.00} ). I was shocked and contacted Capital One to dispute these charges. 

Initially, Capital One credited these four charges, but later reversed them.

I meticulously prepared my supporting documents this time, including all email correspondence with the XXXX, highlighted important sections, and conducted online searches to find any published terms and cancellation policies. I found their terms but no cancellation policy. I also included complaints against the XXXX. 

Regarding the charges of {$410.00} and {$200.00}, the XXXX added a new statement to the cancellation policy that was not present in previous versions. I pointed out that this was evidence of the XXXX fabricating documents. 

I uploaded my response with supporting documents ( XXXX to XXXX pages ) for all eight transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Capital One denied all my disputes except for one transaction of {$29.00}. Despite contacting Capital One over 12 times to resolve the issue and respectfully requesting reinvestigation of the XXXX and authentication of their documents, the disputed amounts were not credited back to my account.

I am seeking assistance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). If necessary, I can provide the documents that I submitted to Capital One upon request.

By XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$1400.00} and I spent {$600.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX they downgraded my credit limit from {$1500.00} to {$800.00}. The system said that I had {$600.00} in card balance and I had {$190.00} available credit which is true that I had spent {$600.00} in XXXX however I paid a total of {$1400.00} and there's {$680.00} that is unaccounted for. There was one customer service rep who told me on around XX/XX/XXXX that I overpaid and I would have full limits and receive a check for anything I paid beyond the {$800.00} limit after my payment was applied on XX/XX/XXXX. The backend system made a mistake and when my payment was applied on XX/XX/XXXX, it incorrectly said that I have only {$190.00} when I should have had no limits and I was supposed to receive a check for {$79.00}.

Because Goldman Sachs is now doing incorrect math ( which I suspect is because their backend database isn't properly equipped to apply payments properly when a credit limit is downsized in the middle of a billing cycle ), here is the new formula of what happened : {$1400.00} ( total paid in XXXX ) - {$600.00} ( total spent in XXXX as of XXXX ) - {$190.00} ( available credit to me on XX/XX/XXXX ) = {$680.00} ( total amount that is unaccounted for ).",,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,MI,48212,,Consent provided,Web,01/14/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8155818.0

In response, the bank began calling me XXXX to XXXX times per day, cycling through over XXXX different phone numbers. I have screenshots and voicemail recordings documenting this.

Immediately after the payment posted, Amex reduced my credit limit by {$5600.00} resulting in a transaction denial and financial harm. 

I received no prior notice of this credit reduction. During multiple calls and chats, Amex representatives and a supervisor confirmed : 1. No 45-day advance notice was issued ( in violation of TILA 12 CFR 1026.9 ) 2. No adverse action letter was provided, despite the decision being based on my credit profile ( in violation of ECOA XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ) 3. My credit score and utilization ratio were negatively impacted by the limit drop ( in violation of FCRA XXXX U.S.C. XXXXm ) Instead of resolving the issue, Amex offered a solution where I could pay an additional {$5200.00} to guarantee reinstatement of my original limit with a waiting period of up to XXXX business days. 

I repeatedly requested documentation of the credit decision, including certified mail tracking or internal records, and was told that nothing could be emailed. I also requested a transcript or recording of the call, which Amex stated could only be obtained through a subpoena. 

I was refused a live escalation to anyone with authority to resolve the issue, despite multiple formal requests and confirmation this was a legal dispute. This behavior paired with the timing of the credit reduction reflects coercive and abusive financial practices, and amounts to constructive fraud, bad faith, and unjust enrichment. 

Additionally, this conduct violates fundamental principles of equity and trust law. By accepting a large payment from me in good faith, then restricting my access to that credit without lawful notice or justification, Amex breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violated my right to equitable reliance. The company profited from my performance under the credit agreement while obstructing my access to the very benefit of that agreement. 

I am requesting : Immediate reinstatement of my original credit limit A refund of the {$6000.00} payment if credit access remains restricted A full investigation and written explanation Reversal of all damage to my credit profile I have preserved a full transcript, names, timestamps, and a legally valid recording of the call.

'' I explained that XXXX had assured me the service would resolve the issue, but it did not, causing me to incur additional costs with another repair shop. I provided Capitol One with all the relevant information, but they did not request supporting documentation at that time, which I found unusual. 
On XX/XX/year>, Capitol One sent me an updated letter stating that my claim had been denied, citing that the goods were as described and in good condition. They instructed me to provide supporting documentation by XX/XX/year>, in order to proceed. I complied and submitted all the requested documents on XX/XX/year>, including the sales invoice, a detailed letter outlining my attempt to resolve the issue with XXXX, and the invoice from the new shop showing that the work had to be redone. Despite submitting these documents, Capitol One denied my claim again within XXXX XXXX 
On XX/XX/year>, I called Capitol One and spoke with a manager, XXXX, who informed me that I needed to provide a letter from the second repair shop on their letterhead, explaining why the work from XXXX was not completed properly. I informed XXXX that this information was already noted on the invoice, but I would obtain the requested letter. XXXX confirmed that this letter was the only additional documentation needed to continue the case. 
On XX/XX/year>, I obtained the requested letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and resubmitted all my evidence to Capitol One. However, Capitol One once again denied my claim within an hour. 

On XX/XX/year>, I called Capitol Once again, only to be told that I needed to provide a credit voucher from XXXX. Since XXXX refused to provide a credit or resolve the issue, I was unable to obtain such a voucher. I explained this to Capitol One and referenced my prior conversation with Manager XXXX, who had assured me that the letter from the second shop would suffice. Despite providing all required documentation, including the requested letter, Capitol One continued to deny my claim. 
Furthermore, when I spoke with Managers XXXX ( ID XXXX ) and XXXX ( ID XXXX ), they refused to submit my case for pre-arbitration with XXXX, despite my having provided sufficient evidence, as outlined in the XXXX chargeback guide ( Section 3.24.6 ). Their refusal, combined with their rude behavior and disconnection of calls, has caused significant delays and frustration in resolving this matter. 
Given the clear violation of Regulation Z and the failure to properly handle my dispute, I request that Capitol One credit my account permanently for this disputed charge. If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. 
I have included all my documents along with this case along with the XXXX dispute guide showing explaining my evidence is enough. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue.

11/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/2023, I had to take an emergency medical leave of absence from work for mental health reasons. This was an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so I was not able to get XXXX and insurance claims established until after I had taken the leave from work. Due to this, I have not been getting paid and have gone 6 weeks without receiving any payment. 

On XX/XX/2023, I finally received two checks in the mail from the State of California Employment Development Department. The first check was for an amount of {$6200.00}, while the second was {$3000.00}, making a total of {$9200.00}. 

After receiving these checks, my first action was to go to my local Chase branch and deposit the checks in person at XXXXXXXX XXXX on Wednesday, XX/XX/2023. I hoped this would make the funds available within 1 3 business days. On Thursday ( XX/XX/2023 ), I checked the status of the deposit and received a notification stating that the funds would be held until XX/XX/2023. I was not given this information when I deposited the checks with the bank teller the day prior. I have not had any funds for 2 weeks, and waiting until XX/XX/2023 is not feasible. If I had been informed of the hold time before depositing the check, I would have made other arrangements, as I need these funds as soon as possible. 

I then called the XXXX XXXX department and spoke with XXXX. This representative was very helpful. I explained that I have been completely out of funds for the past 2 weeks and currently have no money to pay for my medication, food, bills, or gas. I also shared that I had to take a medical leave of absence from work due to mental health, and this financial situation is greatly exacerbating the issues I am experiencing. I offered to provide medical documentation to verify my situation and why I received these funds from the State of California. 

XXXX said that this was not necessary and I do not need to provide medical documentation ; the funds will be made available to me on XX/XX/2023 since they now understand my situation. I was very grateful for his help and was instructed that if the funds were not made available to me automatically on XX/XX/2023, I would just need to call back, and the funds would be released. 

On Friday morning, XX/XX/2023, the funds were not available, so I called at XXXX XXXX as instructed. The agent I spoke with this time said that the funds had not been received from the State of California, but as soon as the funds were received, they would be made available to me, and I would not need to wait until XX/XX/2023 ; I would receive the funds on XX/XX/2023. 

At XXXX XXXX I had not received the funds, so I called again to check on the status. I was then told that I will not be receiving the funds until XX/XX/2023. After being asked to speak with a supervisor, I was informed that the money has still not been received, and I can try calling again later. 

At XXXXXXXX XXXX, I still had not received the funds, so I called again. I asked to be escalated to a supervisor and was now told at this time that I need to provide medical documentation, and they will then decide if they will release the funds to me early. Its Friday night, and the banks close in 30 minutes, so I can not provide this until the next business day. I could have provided this on Thursday morning, but I was told I did not need to. 

I am now in a very difficult situation. I was behind on bills and arranged payments for my bills on XX/XX/2023, as I was promised I would have the funds by this date. I have no money to pay for medication, food, or gas, and I am running the risk of losing services such as electricity and phone. I have no money for gas or food, so I have to sit at home and wait for the funds of these XXXX funds to be made available ; I am out of medication and can not even get this. I took a leave of absence for mental health, and I have been working to get better for the past 5 weeks. I had been making progress and felt happy for the first time in over 1 year. 

This situation with XXXX has undone my progress over the past 5 weeks. After waiting for 6 weeks and struggling to get by, I was finally paid for my XXXX claim, then Chase bank said they wont release the funds for nearly 2 weeks. After speaking with a customer service agent, I was assured I did not need to provide any medical documentation, and I would receive the funds on XX/XX/2023. On XXXXXXXX XXXX on Friday night, XX/XX/2023, I was then told I need to bring in medical documentation for them to even consider releasing the funds to me, and I am greatly suffering.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,92037,,Consent provided,Web,11/18/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7867229.0

I have exhausted all reasonable efforts to resolve this matter directly with the issuer, Apple, but the issue remains unresolved despite numerous attempts. Here are the details of the situation : On XXXX, XXXX, I initially set up a XXXX order, and subsequently canceled the order after the initial trial period. Between XXXX and XXXX, no charges appeared on my Apple Card account, indicating that the cancellation was successful. On XX/XX/XXXX, an unauthorized charge of {$77.00} was authorized on my Apple Card account by the merchant. I promptly disputed these unauthorized charges on XX/XX/XXXX, with Apple Card customer service. Disputes were filed again on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, as the unauthorized charges were not rectified. The charges for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, were recently reversed. However, these reversals came after multiple disputes were filed, indicating that the charges were indeed unauthorized. Throughout this process, new card numbers were issued each time by Apple due to the unauthorized charges. Despite this, the unauthorized charges continued to occur due to Apple 's participation in an updater program with the merchant. Apple acknowledged in my communications with their customer service that the updater program does not function as intended in the case of unauthorized charges, demonstrating their own awareness of the issue. I have made diligent efforts to resolve this matter with Apple, but their failure to prevent unauthorized charges and their lack of effective action have led me to this point of filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The recurring unauthorized charges, despite multiple disputes and new card numbers issued, have caused considerable frustration and financial inconvenience. I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene and investigate this matter on my behalf to ensure that these unauthorized charges are properly resolved, and appropriate measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future. At a minimum, I am asking that they credit my account for the charges that were reversed for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( and to really honor their zero liability pledge, the dispute for XX/XX/XXXX should also be honored ). I believe that it is in the best interest of consumers to have a secure and reliable financial system, and Apple 's inadequate response raises concerns about their commitment to protecting their customers ' financial well-being. Enclosed with this letter, please find copies of relevant documents, including communication records with Apple, transaction statements, and dispute documentation.

04/23/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Institution Complained Against : American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT On XX/XX/year>, I, XXXX XXXX, acting as the authorized representative of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, submitted a lawfully issued security instrument in the amount of {$1000.00} as a secured payment coupon to American Express in accordance with trust and private settlement protocols. This instrument was accepted in-hand by their office. 

However, American Express failed to return the original negotiable instrument. Instead, they responded : We were unable to process your payment of {$1000.00} received on XX/XX/year> because it wasnt an acceptable form of payment. 

Despite this so-called rejection, the original instrument was never returned, and instead a photocopied facsimile was mailed back on plain paper, clearly demonstrating that the original was converted, retained, or disposed of unlawfully. This action violates the following statutes and regulations : VIOLATIONS CITED 1. UCC 3-603 Tender of Payment Once tender of payment is made, and the obligee unjustifiably refuses to accept the tender, the obligor is discharged as if payment had been made. American Express failed to process the valid instrument or reject it in accordance with 3-603 ( a ) and ( b ).

2. UCC 3-604 Discharge by Cancellation or Renunciation Retention and dishonor without returning the original creates an unlawful cancellation or impairment of the instrument, especially when no lawful rejection or return under protest was performed.

3. Conversion and Commercial Dishonor By refusing to return the original trust-issued negotiable instrument, American Express has unlawfully converted private trust property, an act tantamount to theft under commercial law, violating fiduciary and consumer financial obligations.

4. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Fair Dealing ( 12 CFR 1002.4 ) American Express failed in its duty to handle consumer payments and private trust instruments with good faith and in accordance with applicable consumer financial protection laws.

5. Failure to Provide Proper Accounting and Fair Credit Reporting ( 12 CFR 1026.7 ) As no valid rejection was issued and the payment was converted, the balance should have been credited. American Express failed to credit the account and failed to provide proper statements reflecting the tender.

6. breach of indentured agreements & Sec filings DEMAND FOR CREDIT & CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES Due to American Expresss dishonor without lawful protest, conversion of trust property, and failure to credit a valid payment, I am demanding : Immediate credit to Account # XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00} as required by UCC 3-603 and 3-604.

Return of the original security instrument, or a sworn affidavit explaining its disposal or conversion.

Civil Money Penalties beginning at {$25000.00} USD, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5565 ( a ), for the unlawful seizure and dishonor of trust-based negotiable instruments. This penalty includes : {$1000.00} per day for willful dishonor, {$5000.00} for unauthorized retention, {$15000.00} for failure to return trust property and resolve dispute in good faith.

Further refusal to act in equity and good faith will result in lien enforcement, private arbitration, and escalation to additional federal and regulatory enforcement bodies including : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Federal Reserve Board Legal Division IRS Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ( TIGTA ) REMEDY REQUESTED 1.Immediate credit of {$1000.00} to the account.

2.Return of the original security instrument or affidavit of handling.

3.Enforcement of civil money penalties beginning at {$25000.00}.

4.Written acknowledgment of wrongdoing and commitment to policy correction.

10/16/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"I discovered fraudulent charges on my PayPal account totaling {$1100.00} from XXXX. 

I filed a claim with PayPal regarding these fraudulent charges at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX That claim # is Case # XXXX At approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I get a response from PayPal stating "" We've completed our review of your unauthorized activity case, and weve determined there was no unauthorized use. Based on our review, we found this transaction is consistent with your PayPal payment history ''. 

I haven't ordered from XXXX in years so there is no history of XXXX orders in 3 years. 

Secondly, I've never ordered thousands of dollars in products from XXXX so their conclusion is inconsistent with my purchase history. 

PayPal violated and dishonored their own fraud protection policies. It's also clear there needs to be a wide scale investigation into PayPal 's dealings and partnerships, especially with XXXX and other companies. 

As I was conducting research, I was shocked at the number of people who'd experienced this same and were forced to pay fraudulent charges on their PayPal account. 

PayPal is also violating the Electronic Fund Transfer Act Regulation E, which protects consumers from fraudulent charges.

Furthermore, in their own written PayPal has minimized the issue as being "" unfamiliar transactions '' and "" a disputed payment ''.

This is not the first time I've filed a claim for fraudulent charges on my PayPal account.

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed claim XXXX XXXX which they dismissed and denied as fraudulent charges. I was told to contact the company and take up the issue with the company. The company would not comply. 

I reached out to XXXX to file a fraud claim. Though PayPal denied they were fraudulent charges and is forcing me to continue paying these fraudulent charges, XXXX has frozen my account claiming a chargeback has been processed. This is obviously untrue as PayPal did not refund me for those fraudulent charges. 

So I'm unable to file a fraud claim with XXXX. Furthermore, XXXX referred me back to PayPal to take up the issue with PayPal. 

PayPal claimed to have done a thorough investigation into the matter and state since the address is the same, there is no indication of fraud. 

However, if a thorough investigation was completed by PayPal, there should have been informed uncovered regarding package interceptions, as outlined in this article linked below. 
https : XXXX PayPal 's written statement is proof they are unaware of this issue and serves as proof there was no thorough investigation.

PayPal has made it clear that I am responsible for paying fraudulent charges due to PayPal 's pay in 4 plan and that my card will be charged. This requirement of paying fraudulent charges is a consumer rights violation. 

Furthermore, PayPal has prevented me from removing my debit cards from PayPal 's site, in order to protect myself from further fraudulent charges. 

Again, violating their own consumer fraud protection policies and violating consumer rights. 

At this point PayPal has caused unnecessary stress and exacerbated my medically established diagnosis of XXXX XXXX This has caused me to begin treatments to address this.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",GA,30033,,Consent provided,Web,10/16/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7702602.0

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service to inquire about my accounts and was informed that they had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX due to either late payments or a high balance. This decision has caused me significant distress, as I have never been late on any payments. Additionally, I am aware that other customers with high balances have not faced similar actions. 

The abrupt closure of these accounts poses a serious risk to my credit score and financial stability. I am also concerned that my checking account may be at risk of being closed without notice. This situation has left me feeling both disappointed and uncertain about my relationship with the bank.

To resolve this issue, I respectfully request a thorough review of my accounts and the reasons for their closure. If possible, I would like to have my credit card accounts reopened or, at the very least, have the interest rates adjusted to make repayment more manageable. As a long-time customer, I value transparency and fairness and believe this matter warrants reconsideration.

Summary of the Problem I am filing this complaint against XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX for failing to comply with my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) requires credit reporting agencies to verify accounts through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract upon my request. I sent a formal letter on XX/XX/year>, demanding removal or verification of a certain account on my credit report. Navy Federal Cr Union XXXX I followed up with a second letter, allowing time to delete those unverified accounts. To date, they have not provided proof of the original signed contract nor removed the disputed information. 2. Steps I Have Taken XX/XX/year> : Sent a written demand for physical verification of all disputed accounts, referencing my rights under the FCRA. Next, I sent a follow-up letter demanding deletion of unverified accounts and reminding them of their time to respond. I have not received reply from all 3 bureaus, nor have the disputed items been removed. 3. Applicable Law ( FCRA Violations ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Requires credit bureaus to provide physical verification of an original consumer contract with my signature if they intend to continue reporting an account. FCRA, Section 611 : Mandates the removal of any information that can not be verified within a reasonable period. 4. How This Affects Me These unverified items harm my creditworthiness and ability to obtain loans and other lines of credit. Because the bureaus have not complied with federal law to either verify or remove the disputed items, they continue to report potentially inaccurate or incomplete information on my credit file. 5. What I Want Immediate removal of all unverified and inaccurate accounts from my credit report. Any further relief, as deemed appropriate, including ensuring that the credit bureaus remove all related inquiries and notations that harm my credit standing. I trust the CFPB will review this complaint and take action to ensure the credit bureaus comply with the FCRA.

The previous XXXX claimed that my phone number didnt meet their verification criteria but refused to disclose what those criteria were. The supervisor then told me she had unlocked my account, but I was unable to log in the next morning. 

Despite my persistence and receiving verification codes on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  ( code : XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  ( code : XXXX ), XXXX still insisted that my account was not verified, even after confirming my date of birth, social security number, and secret word. When I asked if I could submit electronic verification using my passport or green card number, my request was denied. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I was advised to call back later that night to speak with a supervisor. I did so at XXXX XXXX  the next morning, yet again, XXXX would not clarify why my phone number, social security number, date of birth, and secret passcode were insufficient for verification. They claimed they left a voicemail detailing the hold on my account on XX/XX/XXXX, but I did not receive any voicemail.

In XXXX the 90 days had surpassed and I got a phone call asking to collect an overdue payment.

I told him i had no clue what this person purchased only that when i first called 6 months ago, I was told it was one {$400.00} and one {$500.00} purchase made. He then said theyd send me a statement so i could dispute the individual claims and I have received NOTHING.

04/15/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"APPEAL FOR FRAUD XX/XX/year> Money Network Financial XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Department Dispute Case ID : XXXX Attachments : State Drivers License and Current Banking Institution To whom it may Concern : I am replying to my original dispute placed on XX/XX/year>. What I believed to be so straightforward has now pushed me to the point of breaking out in hives. I am currently looking to retain counsel due to the stress your bank has caused me. I am on XXXX, and this is the money I am receiving for that. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so I have a very astute sense of the issue and this illegal what your bank is doing. 

Here is the timeline of events, the actions I am taking and the resolution I would like to see. 

Original Issue : XXXX, XX/XX/year> o I woke up with a notification from XXXX that my XXXX payment ( {$3200.00} ) was deposited into my Money Network Account. 
o Upon Logging onto the account, I had noticed the money was transferred within 30 minutes after it was deposited. 
The total amount transferred was {$3200.00} o What struck me as odd was I did not initiate this o It was within minutes of the deposit which I never log on that soon ( it is XXXX California XXXX XXXX ) time o The amount is not what I usually transfer. I always transfer the full amount to my own bank, a credit union o When I looked the account numbers were not mine ( reference my account attached I am showing the last 5 digits out of safety ( I can no longer can log onto the app due to the account being closed ) o I immediately called Money Network to dispute the fraudulent transaction and close the account o The representative, closes my account, tells me she will expedite a card for {$8.00} and I will need to send the dispute o She said they will do research to determine the issue and let you know o I was happy since it seemed there was a resolution. 


Wednesday XX/XX/year> XXXX  XX/XX/year> o I call and speak to 5 different representatives ( one being a supervisor ) ( spent 6hrs on the phone total ) o One told me the money was in my new account ( there was a green light ). Her name was XXXX, and her phone extension was XXXX ( there is no way to get any accountability from the employees that you call into ) o One put me on hold for 58 minutes till I finally hung up o One told me a card was not sent and that the dispute was denied, and that XXXX needs to open an account and send me card o Finally, a supervisor told me that I will need to dispute it and no card was sent. She told me that she would put a trace in and once they traced it, I would have to call the bank the money was sent to, and I NEED TO GET IT BACK! * *Ive worked for XXXX and XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX That is the banks job, not the customers. I am blown away by all of this o I ALSO RECEIVED THE DISPUTE VIA US MAIL. WITH A FEW SENTENCES SAYING THAT WE ( MONEY NETWORK ) HAVE DETERIMINED NO ERROR OCCURRED. SO, IN ONE DAY YOU ALL TRACED THE BANK AND FOUND I OPENED THAT ACCOUNT? ITS FRAUD. IT USUALLY TAKES 30-90 DAYS TO RESOLVE o On XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX I went to the XXXX site office ( in person ) in southern California XXXX 
o XXXX said they have nothing to do with Banking. They do not send cards nor open accounts ; Money Network opens the account and XXXX just wire/Deposits the money o I also have moved forward with HARD CHECKS ONLY from XXXX, I will not be utilizing Money Network XXXX 
o I now need to get my {$3200.00} back from Money Network that the XXXX deposited. 

THINGS TO MAKE NOTE OF : o How is it that when I call, I need to do a 2-factor authentication to verify the account, but someone can transfer upwards of thousands through an APP ( I only had the app and never did anything online with a computer ) and was able to without a text to my number nor any sort of verification?

o 1-day internal investigation?!??! UNREAL!

o I have added the original submission of the dispute below o My current drivers license o My current banking information ( for comparison against the fraudulent transaction it was routed to, if you look, they do not match ) o I believe this was an internal issue. Someone knew of this amount and went ahead a transferred it without any difficulty and now you guys within a day say you have no fault? 


NEXT STEPS : o I am logging a complaint with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation : they regulate a variety of financial services, businesses, products, and professionals. The department operates under the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency.

o I am also logging a complaint with the Federal Reserve Consumer Help. You may file a complaint if you think a bank has been unfair or misleading, discriminated against you in lending, or violated a federal consumer protection law or regulation. 
o I am also logging a police report with my local law enforcement department : XXXX XXXX, CA. 
o I am also logging a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission o Lastly, I am searching for an attorney to take on this case if I do not receive my money in XXXX weeks. I should not have to contact anyone outside of the Money Network institution and so forth to get my money. That is your job as a financial institution to protect my money and rights. And you have now left me open to scammers and what not and expect me to go get my money? I dont think so. I will be like a dog with a bone. I dont care how long I have to carry this on, I will get my money and expose this bank if I have no action in two weeks.

Key Facts of the Complaint : I enrolled in a Debt Management Plan ( DMP ) through XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/year>. 

Capital One initially accepted payments through th

e DMP. I have made every DMP payment on time and in full sinc
e enrollment.

Despite my compliance, Capital One charged off my account.

The creditor stopped accepting payments through the DMP, causing further financial harm. 
They are inaccurately reporting missed payments and the charge-off to credit bureaus. 

My credit report now reflects a charge-off and delinquencies that never occurred based on my DMP compliance. 
This unfairly damages my credit, making it harder to recover financially. 
This appears to be a violation of consumer protection laws. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires accurate reporting. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) prohibits misleading debt collection tactics.

I attempted to file this dispute three different times, and each time I encountered severe incompetence and unprofessional behavior from Chase representatives.

One particular representative claimed he could not see a date on a document I submitted. When I offered to re-upload a clearer version, he refused to help and threatened to hang up on me. This level of disrespect is unacceptable under any circumstances, let alone during a dispute process. 
Furthermore, I believe that once representatives realized I am an XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX my concerns were not taken seriously.

A formal apology be issued for the mistreatment I experienced. 


Proper disciplinary action be taken against any employees who acted unprofessionally.

I was informed of the fraud alert on XX/XX/2025. I was only informed due to the fact that I had no access to my bank account or the funds within it and so I made a call to Citibank customer support in which I was informed. After an extensive amount of time on the phone with different representatives of different departments, I was not given any information pertaining to the fraud alert, and was only told that my account would be closed within the month and that the balance within the account will be sent via check within 30 to 60 days. At the time of the closure, there was approximately {$30000.00} USD given that I am a small business. It was essentially all the money required to run the business which has since given me extreme difficulty functioning without. In order to attempt to correct the issue I have spoken to representatives on the phone as well as representatives within a branch location as well as my personal banker for my business account.

11-03-2023,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"4 years ago I was approved for Citibank MasterCard World Elite travel card and I've continually made on Time payments and have never missed a payment and have never been late on a payment and have always paid more than the payment amount. In XXXX of this year 2023, my mother who was diagnosed with XXXX got into almost fatal car accident which rendered her unable to care for herself so she had to come stay with me and I had to be out of work for 4 months so I was using my credit that I had worked so hard for to get us by. I used a good portion of my credit over these XXXX months and then after paying almost {$11000.00} on this Citibank card to pay down the balance they decreased my credit limit not once but twice. They decreased it all the way down to what was left on this credit card after I paid the {$11000.00} on it, they decreased it all the way down to what I still had to pay off which made it look like I've maxed this card out again with the personal credit companies which affects my credit score which affects everything else.that I've worked so hard on paying off. They have done.this to a lot of other accounts holders and it's really bad business and almost a lie. My credit limit started out at XXXX and then they raised it to XXXX and then they decreased it to XXXX and then they decreased it all the way down to XXXX XXXX with no warning and after I've paid {$11000.00} on this card. Their business practice are affecting my credit score my other lenders and my interest rate and daily living on other things. I have never missed a payment, I've never made a late payment, and I've always paid more than they've billed me. I just think this is really dirty business practice and they are using their corporate power to hurt the consumer. I have paid over {$35000.00} to pay my credit cards off in the last 45 days with {$11000.00} going to this Citibank card. They would have been better off closing this account and allowing me time to pay it other than just making it look like I'm maxing out this credit limit on this card when they've lowered it by {$11000.00} in 2 months and only after I paid {$11000.00} on this card. I really would understand if I was a bad customer or if I was late on my payment or if I missed a payment but in 4 years I've never missed or been late on a payment. I just don't understand how they're allowed to do this and they are really affecting my daily life using my credit for the better good of me and my family.ive worked really hard on myself and my finances over the last 10 years and this unfair practice by Citibank is really affecting me and my credit score, among other things. It goes way past them lowering a credit limit.

10/31/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"Back in XXXX I applied for a credit card with Chase called Chase Freedom Unlimited. I specifically chose to apply with them because of the promotion they had to get {$200.00} cash back after spending {$500.00} in the first 3 months of having the credit card. 

I was able to meet that requirement probably within the first month of the card opening. I noticed however that they did not apply the promotion to my account even after the fact. 

I initially called them about a month ago to inquire and I was told that it was a mistake and that they were going to send an escalation. I then receive a letter about a week or so later saying that they are not able to apply the promotion. 

I called a second time and this time, the representative stated that the first representative didn't do the escalation properly and that I shouldn't worry about having to call about the same issue again. It will be taken care of. 

This week ( XXXX XXXX, 2024 ) ; I received another letter and this time saying that the promotion was never in the account to begin with. So I called and talked to a supervisor who told me the same. They also asked me for proof of application which realistically nobody does when applying for a credit card. 

My question is why was that never mentioned in the beginning when I first got approved. It wasn't mentioned the first or the second time I called and brought this to their attention. Yet they expect me to have proof that I had the promotion when I applied. 

I asked them to provide the writing where it said I wasn't getting the promotion when I first got approved. They are not able to provide that either. 

I feel like it was a click bait and I was mislead with multiple different information. I didn't have this issue with any credit cards in the past. So I feel like it was a dirty tactic to get people to apply but not honor the promotion.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,95123,,Consent provided,Web,10/31/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10637295.0

I didn't ask for the money and thought she shouldn't send me that much money, so I graciously accepted {$100.00} with gratitude for groceries for my children. As a single mom, any financial help is good, times are tough. 
I sent back {$300.00} to the account that I thought was my mom 's. The same name. The email address she's used forever. I didn't think twice because everything matched up. However, the account was not owned or connected to my mom and she never received the {$300.00}. PayPal told me to reach out to the person who received the money and ask for a refund, which I did, several times to only receive XXXX mysteriously deposited into my account. I have called PayPal and sent messages. I have asked my mom to do the same. She claims she never received the money and that account is not in any way connected to her. I honestly don't understand why PayPal can't cancel the transaction or refund the money. I tried to cancel the transaction, .but that option wasn't even available to me. I really hope someone can help me with this. This is a lot of money for someone who is on a fixed income. This is devastating to me on behalf of my mom. I feel awful this happened and want to help and make sure she gets her money back. Please, if you could help me, I would greatly appreciate it.

A few months ago, I deposited a cheque at Chase Bank, which was my two months ' security deposit from my previous apartment. The said amount was successfully recognized and credited to my bank account within a few days. However, distressingly, Chase Bank proceeded to close my account suddenly, without prior notification. More worrisome is the fact that they retained my deposited funds and only provided a refund for the other balance in my account. 

When reaching out to Chase for clarification, I was informed that they could not release my funds before they successfully verified the management company of the apartment complex I previously resided in. It baffles me why they would credit the check to my account in the first place, only to later state that verification of the source of the funds was required. 

Chase Bank, furthermore, indicated that if verification was unsuccessful, my funds would be transferred to the state.

Key Points of My Dispute : 1. The item is defective and does not work as advertised. Despite PayPals claim that the seller accurately described the product, this is false. The product does not function in the manner described in the listing, making it Significantly Not as Described under PayPals Purchase Protection policy. 
2. PayPal misrepresented the facts of the case. The response I received falsely claims that my dispute is based on personal preference rather than functionality. However, my complaint explicitly states that the item does not perform as advertised. This is a clear violation of PayPals policies. 
3. PayPal has denied me consumer protection. The item was not delivered in the promised condition. Denying my claim despite this evidence violates PayPals own policies on protecting buyers from fraudulent or misleading transactions. 

I demand that PayPal properly review my claim with all evidence considered, or I will escalate this complaint to [ Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or relevant legal entities ]. I expect a resolution that includes a full refund, as I have been sold a non-functional product under false pretenses.

As the late payment reporting is erroneous, I demand that you correct this information immediately with all credit reporting agencies that have received it. 

3. **Investigation of Disputes ( Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ) ** : Upon receiving notice of a dispute from a consumer, the FCRA requires furnishers to conduct a reasonable investigation into the disputed information.

Failure to comply with the FCRA could result in legal action against XXXX XXXX. If these inaccuracies are not promptly resolved and corrected, I am prepared to take legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA.

12/19/23,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX a packaged for {$710.00}, I ordered with Best Buy using my Best Buy Citibank Credit Card was delivered by XXXX XXXX At the time of delivery, I was on a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. That cruise was from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I also provided the credit card company proof of that during this dispute. I got home from the cruise on XX/XX/XXXX and did not have a text message saying a package was delivered. Which was odd because we have parcel locker boxes that XXXX and other carriers are supposed to use which stores the package in locked box and will send you a text and code to get your package. My apartment complex provides these boxes so stuff like this doesn't happen. I looked up my XXXX XXXX number and the proof of delivery photo shows it on a counter which is located downstairs in my apartment complex across from the USPS boxes. I went down there and the package was not there. Anyone who walks in this building could have taken it. Why was it not put in a parcel locker box? Why was it not delivered to my address apt door # on the shipping address? I immediately called XXXX and opened an investigation on this situation. That following Thursday XXXX called me back stating that Best Buy is the shipper and needed to call them and file a lost and stolen claim as they were at fault for not delivering the package properly. I took every step possible to try and get Best Buy to contact XXXX and do what they asked and they refused stating it was delivered properly based on proof of delivery. I have a chat log showing me telling them to contact XXXX and do that as well. Bottom line is though it wasn't delivered properly. Proper delivery would be them delivering it to my apartment door # listed on the shipping address, which the proof of delivery photo from XXXX, when you look up the tracking #, shows it was left on a counter. That is not my shipping address apartment door. So it was not delivered properly. And anyone could have taken that package, including the driver after snapping that picture based on where it was located. To top it off, I was on a cruise ship on XX/XX/XXXX. I couldn't even check then and they should have either brought it to my door listed on the shipping address or put it in a parcel locker box which would have secured the package and this would have never happened. Listen, I can't force Best Buy to call XXXX and file a lost and stolen claim like XXXX said for them to do. But it also wont let me file that claim, because best buy and XXXX have a contractual agreement and they need to be the ones to do it. So I had one last option, file a dispute with my Best Buy Credit Card who is done by Citibank. I filed this dispute with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX after spending hours on the phone with best buy and XXXX trying to get this fixed. I just wanted my item, that I never received. But Best Buy was not doing what XXXX asked and I can't again force Best Buy to listen. So I filed this dispute with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$710.00} for not receiving the item and because it was not delivered properly. I sent Citibank tons of proof and documentation. Including a best buy chat log showing me to tell them to contact XXXX and file a lost and stolen claim, a police report, I sent them the XXXX proof of delivery photo which shows the package on a counter and not delivered properly to my apartment door etc. A few days ago Citibank closed this claim, stating Best Buy sent them proof of delivery stating they will not charge it back or refund the item and it was delivered properly. Honestly, I beyond disbelief at how this has been handled. I clearly showed Citibank proof with the proof of delivery photo from XXXX that it was not delivered to my apartment door. I sent them a police report and all this information. Why would I spend XXXX plus hours, file a police report and go through all this if I had the package? I was on a cruise ship when it was delivered and where it was delivered was in an open area downstairs in my complex. not a parcel locker box which we have here which would have secured it, not my actual apartment door which is listed on the shipping address. Also the item is {$710.00} how come they didnt ask for signature or put it at a XXXX drop off location if they had issue or because of the value of the item. I am filing this against, Citibank for denying my claim and accepting what best buy said when its not even valid especially with all the proof I provided. If I am not refunded, I will be seeking legal action. Also I have a XXXX credit score, I have never been late on any payments and I have no debt. So I am extremely upset at Citibanks handling on this. I should not have to pay for item that was not properly delivered and was stolen.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,328XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/19/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8028171.0

This request is in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ), asserting that I dispute your claim and seek validation. Kindly forward a copy of this request to the relevant creditor.

I want to clarify that this is not a mere request for "" verification '' or proof of my mailing address. Rather, it is a formal VALIDATION request, as stipulated by the aforementioned Title and Section. I respectfully urge your offices to provide me with credible evidence establishing my legal obligation to pay this debt. Please provide the following : 1. Identify the original creditor and specify the purpose of the claimed debt.

2. Clearly explain and substantiate how the alleged debt amount was calculated.

3. Furnish copies of any documents demonstrating my agreement to the asserted debt.

4. Provide verification or a copy of any applicable judgment, if applicable.

5. Demonstrate that the Statute of Limitations has not expired for this account.

6. Show that the creditor is authorized to collect in my state.

7. Provide me with the creditor 's license numbers and Registered Agent details. 

I'd like to emphasize that if your offices have reported unverified information to XXXX, XXXX, or TransUnion, such action may potentially constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. I must assert that if any derogatory information appears on any of my credit reports due to your actions or the actions of the represented company, I will not hesitate to initiate legal action against you for : - Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act - Defamation of Character I trust that you will provide the necessary documentation within 30 days from the receipt of this letter. During this time, all collection and reporting activities related to these accounts must cease. 

Please be advised that any adverse actions affecting my credit reports taken during this validation period will lead me to consult my legal counsel for appropriate action. This includes inaccuracies in reporting or verifying an account as accurate without providing supporting proof. 

Should your offices fail to respond to this validation request within the specified timeframe, I demand that all references to the mentioned accounts be promptly deleted and entirely removed from my credit file. Furthermore, I expect a copy of the deletion request to be sent to me immediately. 

Additionally, I kindly request that the credit bureau or creditor refrain from making telephone contact with me, whether at my residence or place of employment. Any such communication attempts will be deemed harassment, compelling me to pursue legal recourse. I insist that all future communications be conveyed in writing and sent to the address indicated in this letter via USPS.

I called to ask the reason for the credit limit decrease and was informed it's their right and if not paid by the 12 month it would be off the new credit limit. Subsequently the year hit and the interest was added which I was aware of. However, Synchrony based the interest of the original card credit limit and not the credit limit they changed the card to midway through. I called to dispute and explore medical/pandemic considerations. 
They mailed the payment history as requested but nothing reflecting the credit limit change and the reason for the current interest. They Subsequently sold the account and locked me out from reviewing the full record. The new debt collector stated that's not something they can investigate because Synchrony said the balance is final. I again asked since they are the new owners they should assume full responsibility and investigate the amount to make sure it's accurate.

10/21/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally submit a complaint against HSBC regarding the unjust closure of my accounts. HSBC has closed my accounts without providing a clear or legitimate reason and referenced terms in a hyperlink-controlled document that was neither reasonably presented nor clearly disclosed at the time of account opening. This situation has caused significant financial harm and raises serious concerns under U.S. consumer protection laws.

Details of the Issue : Bank : HSBC Bank USA XXXX. 
Account Types : personal savings, checking, investment, credit cards Date of Closure Notification : XX/XX/year> Reason Provided by HSBC : HSBC has consistently refused to provide any specific reason for the account closure, stating that they reserve the right to close accounts at their discretion, as indicated in a hyperlink attached to the original contract. This clause was not adequately disclosed or highlighted when I opened the account. 

Relevant Legal Concerns : 1. Lack of Clear Contractual Terms : HSBC has indicated that the right to close accounts without reason is detailed in a hyperlink found in the online version of their terms and conditions. This clause was not adequately disclosed or highlighted when I opened the account. According to 12 U.S. Code 5531 ( Unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ), it is unlawful for financial institutions to engage in unfair or deceptive practices, including burying significant contractual terms in hyperlinks that are subject to unilateral modifications by the bank without proper disclosure or customer consent.

2. Unfair and Unreasonable Contract Terms : The clause HSBC refers to effectively allows them to close accounts without explanation, and because the clause was hidden in a hyperlink-controlled document, which can be modified at their discretion, it denies customers the opportunity for informed consent. This violates the principle of fairness under the Truth in Savings Act ( 12 U.S. Code 4302 ), which requires that all terms of a banking contract be clearly and conspicuously disclosed at the time of account opening. The failure to provide a clear, stable, and unmodifiable contract term undermines my ability to make informed decisions and contradicts federal regulations mandating transparency. 

Impact on Me : I have lost access to my funds and accounts without any clear reason or warning, significantly disrupting my personal finances and business activities. 
HSBCs refusal to explain their decision prevents me from addressing or rectifying any potential issues. 
The lack of transparency and fairness in their contractual terms has eroded my trust in their services and damaged my financial standing, possibly affecting my ability to open accounts elsewhere.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CT,06511,,Consent provided,Web,10/21/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10528506.0

I was told that the representative would reach back out to me at the 10 business day mark of the transaction. At this time, I reached back out to the original company for a followup and they gave me two ARN ( Acquirer Reference Number ) numbers to help the bank track the transaction. I did not get called on that XXXX day. I called the branch on the following day to follow up and was told that there was no appetite by management to help me. I called the TD "" Customer Care '' line for help and was told that my card was expunged from my account. They could see that the card WAS on the account, but the data was gone. This did not make sense to me as the transactions are on the account and was told that the refund to the old card should work but was told that because the card is so old, they couldn't do anything. I spoke to a manager and was told the same thing. I tried many times to give them the ARN that I was given but no one seemed to know what the ARN was. They took the numbers and told me that they would escalate my issue to the investigation team at TD Bank but I would need to wait 5-7 business days to hear back from the investigation team. I waited 5 business days and heard nothing so I reached back out to TD Bank to get a status on my investigation from a manager only to find out that no investigation request was put in and that "" It isn't right that I'm being treated this way. '' The person told me they would reach out to me after reaching out to the Investigation team. I have not heard from anyone at TD Bank since. I reached out to the original company and have not heard back from them either. By refusing to help me with this issue, TD Bank has effectively robbed me of {$740.00} and my trust that they actually will help any client if they run into an issue.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,MA,01970,,Consent provided,Web,11-03-2023,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,7798824.0

Anyway, a week into using the card, I called and found out that it was blocked again. But this time they can not unblock it without me sending ID. They just told me because of fraudulent use. But they did not even confirm with me if they are indeed fraudulent. They were all legit purchases. 

Another issue came up when they told me that I can only fax or postal mail the ID. No email or website upload of the document. During this time, I can't even access my account online. 

I was able to send the fax and called if they received it. I've called several times to see if the information on the number of days to process changes. The general information I got says that it takes A WEEK FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THE FAX. I don't know if they are outsourcing it or what but in this day and age, I can't imagine any US company receiving fax that long. After that, it will TAKE TWO WEEKS TO PROCESS THE DOCUMENT.

I recently launched a new business and attempted to pay down my Capital One balances using a new XXXX business account. For reasons unknown to me, the payments were returned. Once I realized the issue, I immediately transferred the funds to my personal account and successfully paid the cards down. 

Shortly after, I discovered that Capital One had closed all of my credit cards without warning or notification. These accounts are regularly used for both personal and business expenses. Their closure now puts me at risk of being denied a small business loan I was preparing to apply for a loan intended to help me purchase and revitalize my familys driving range. 

This is my livelihood, and the closure of these cards severely impacts my credit utilization and payment history XXXX major factors in my credit profile. 

To make matters worse, I reached out to Capital One support and was transferred between XXXX different representatives, none of whom had a clear solution. The final individual I spoke with was dismissive, unprofessional, and unhelpful. There was no effort made to resolve the issue, and I was left without answers, options, or accountability from Capital One. 

This situation is unacceptable. I have been a responsible customer, and I paid the balances down in good faith to improve my credit. To have these accounts closed without a single phone call or email, and then be treated dismissively, is incredibly damaging financially and emotionally.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TX,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,05/21/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13640250.0

11/30/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"Subject : Urgent Matter Application, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Dear Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank, I hope this letter reaches you in good health. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of significant concern regarding the handling of applications submitted to Discover Bank, which have been converted into securities and subsequently traded on the secondary market. It has come to my attention that my applications, in particular, have been utilized for this purpose, and I believe there are critical issues that require immediate attention and resolution. My applications were submitted to Discover Bank under the understanding that they would be processed in accordance with the terms outlined in our binding agreement, and that in return for the investment, I would receive the agreed-upon products and services. However, it has come to my knowledge that these applications have been transformed into securities for trading on the secondary market without my explicit consent. I would like to draw your attention to the following points : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX : The conversion of applications into securities for trading on the secondary market is a practice that, according to my understanding, was not disclosed in our initial agreement. This has raised concerns about the potential misuse of my personal information and the financial benefits derived from these securities trading activities. XXXX XXXX  : I have considered a forensic audit to expose XXXX numbers associated with the securities generated from my applications. This audit aims to determine the amount of money these securities have generated and whether this aligns with the terms of our binding agreement. Material Evidence : As outlined in Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank 's XXXX, XXXX, Prospectus, and Indenture Agreement Form, these documents serve as material evidence of the company 's objectives to attract investors and generate capital through various means, including the trading of securities. Tort Actions and Discrimination : The attempt to use non-public personal information without my explicit written consent for the purpose of discrimination and fraud is deeply troubling. These actions have caused harm to my personal well-being, reputation, and have resulted in the denial of my rights and titles to monthly bonds, interest payments, and proceeds. Upon a thorough review of the XXXX form which is accessible through the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) website, it has become apparent that there are areas where both the parent company and its subsidiary may be at risk of noncompliance and legal ramifications. I believe that it is imperative that this matter be promptly presented to the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors to initiate a comprehensive review and take necessary actions to prevent further damage. The specific points of concern include : Noncompliance Risks : The XXXX form indicates potential areas of noncompliance that may expose both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank to legal and regulatory risks. Legal Implications : Failure to address the identified noncompliance issues could result in legal implications, fines, and damage to the reputation of both entities. It is crucial to assess the severity of these risks and take corrective measures immediately. Responsibility of the Risk Committee : Given the nature of the risks outlined in the XXXX form, it is the responsibility of the Risk Committee to conduct a thorough analysis, assess the potential impact, and formulate strategies to mitigate these risks effectively. Board of Directors Oversight : The Board of Directors should be informed promptly about these compliance and legal risks to ensure transparency and to enable them to make informed decisions that safeguard the interests of the company and its stakeholders. Preventative Measures : Immediate action is necessary to implement preventative measures that align with regulatory requirements and ethical business practices. This will help in safeguarding the company 's integrity and protecting against further legal and compliance risks. I strongly recommend convening a special meeting of the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors to address these concerns. Timely and decisive action is crucial to protect the best interests of Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank. If the proper party is unwilling to provide a remedy for these actions within 21 business days from the receipt of this letter, I intend to use the findings from the forensic audit, along with the aforementioned forms and exhibits, as evidence to recollect all proceeds generated from the security investments. On or before XX/XX/2023, there will be a letter sent by registered mail to both the Parent Company and its Subsidiary ( Discover Bank ). This parcel will contain a medallion-stamped or notarized letter reiterating these concerns. I implore you to treat this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves to avoid further legal action. I look forward to a prompt and amicable resolution to this issue.

I am filing a complaint against American Express National Bank regarding the mishandling of a check issued from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$10000.00}. 

I requested a check withdrawal from my account in XX/XX/2025. The check was supposedly issued on or after XX/XX/2025, but I never received it. There was no tracking number, delivery confirmation, or secure method of dispatch provided by American Express. Despite this, I was asked to sign an indemnity form that would transfer full liability to me for a check that I never received and that they can not prove was delivered. 



Background : This account was funded multiple times via direct deposit from my investor banking account at XXXX XXXX. When I attempted to deposit another {$5000.00} in XX/XX/2025, I was informed that I no longer had access to the account for withdrawals or deposits. I was later told the account had been closedwithout ANY notice. 

Since then, I have been locked out of the account entirely, unable to sign in or view any statements or records. I was not given adequate support or resolution, despite contacting American Express multiple times. 


I ask that this matter be escalated to someone with the proper authority to resolve it, such as a supervisor or executive support. 

I have exhausted every reasonable option available through American Express customer service, including multiple calls and email attempts. My emails to XXXX were returned as undeliverable. Online resources also led to broken or missing pages. 



Why this matters : I have acted in good faith and am simply trying to retrieve money that belongs to me. I should not be held liable for an unsecured, untracked check that never arrived. This is causing undue stress and potential financial hardship.

BANK INFORMATION : Bank Name : Boeing Employees Credit Union ( BECU ) Account Number : XXXX ( last XXXX digit Transaction Dates : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2025 Amount : {$800.00} and {$1500.00} COMPLAINT DETAILS : I was victim of a sophisticated fraud scheme where criminals impersonated my friend and XXXX representatives to obtain my banking security code. On XX/XX/XXXX, unauthorized withdrawals of {$800.00} and {$1500.00} were processed, but my account balance was only {$440.00}, causing my account to go negative by over {$1800.00}. I immediately called the bank that same day to report the fraud. The bank initially provided provisional credit on XX/XX/XXXX but wrongfully reversed it on XX/XX/XXXX, claiming I "" cooperated '' with the scammers.

WHY THE BANK 'S DECISION IS WRONG : 1. Insufficient funds prove unauthorized access : My account balance was only {$440.00} when {$2300.00} was withdrawn - I clearly did not authorize transactions that would overdraw my account by over {$1800.00} ( See attached bank activity ) 2. I was deceived, not cooperative : I believed I was helping a friend and speaking with legitimate XXXX representatives 3. Immediate reporting : I called the bank the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when I discovered the negative balance 4. Evidence of criminal activity : All text conversations were deleted by the criminals see attached screen shot of my text messages ) 5. Unauthorized access : The caller had my banking information without my consent 6. Violation of Regulation E : The bank failed to properly investigate unauthorized electronic transfers BANK 'S RESPONSE : The bank claims this is a "" scam, not fraud '' and refuses to reimburse me. This distinction is improper - I was a victim of deception, not a willing participant in wrongdoing. 
REQUESTED RESOLUTION : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and require Boeing Employees Credit Union ( BECU ) to : 1. Reimburse the full amount of {$2300.00} 2. Provide proper fraud protections to customers 3. Improve their fraud investigation procedures I have attached documentation including bank statements and police report reference number [ if available ].

This is the second time I am submitting a complaint, as my initial concerns were not adequately addressed, and the violations persist. 

I would like to bring to your attention the following violations that have been ongoing : Inaccurate Personal Information : Violation : Violations of FCRA Section 607 ( a ) and 611.

Specifics : The inaccurate reporting of my previous addresses, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX , has resulted in misleading information being associated with my credit report. 
Unauthorized Inquiries : Violation : Violations of FCRA Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( B ) and Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( F ).

Specifics : Unauthorized credit inquiries were conducted by various creditors without my explicit consent, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX, XXXX , XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. These inquiries have negatively impacted my credit score and financial standing.

Disputed Account Information : Violation : Violations of FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) and Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Specifics : Despite my previous dispute, Bank of America 's account number 63 remains on my credit report with questionable and unverified information. This has led to confusion and further damaged my creditworthiness.

These violations have taken a toll on my personal and financial life. Allow me to share my personal story to emphasize the severity of the situation. As a single parent working diligently to provide for my family, my credit score plays a pivotal role in my ability to secure housing, obtain fair lending terms, and secure a stable financial future for my children. The inaccuracies and unauthorized inquiries have led to undue stress, denied opportunities, and financial setbacks that continue to haunt me. For instance, due to the inaccuracies in my credit report, I was denied housing at my preferred location, impacting the quality of life for my children. 

I implore you to enforce the legal protections outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act to rectify these violations. I kindly request that you investigate the aforementioned creditors and ensure that the unverified and inaccurate information is promptly removed from my credit report. I believe that my efforts to correct these issues align with the goal of fostering fair and accurate credit reporting practices that protect consumers like myself. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and the efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in safeguarding consumers ' rights. Your intervention is essential in bringing resolution to this distressing situation. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I humbly request your intervention to ensure that the legal provisions are enforced and that the involved creditors rectify the situation. 

FCRA Violations : Inaccurate Information on Credit Report : I have discovered inaccurate information on my credit report that has deeply affected my ability to secure loans and maintain financial stability. Per FCRA Section 611, I exercised my right to dispute these inaccuracies through the prescribed procedures. Subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) emphasizes the importance of accurate credit reporting, yet these inaccuracies persist, violating my rights as a consumer. 

Unauthorized Inquiry : My credit report shows unauthorized inquiries by entities such as XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and others. FCRA Section 604 outlines permissible purposes for consumer reports, but I did not provide consent for these inquiries. Subsection ( a ) ( 3 ) ( F ) stipulates the necessity of a legitimate business need for such inquiries, which has not been fulfilled in these cases. 

Unauthorized Reporting to Credit Report without Permission : It has come to my attention that certain entities, such as XXXX XXXX XXXX and others, have reported accounts to my credit report without my explicit permission. This violates FCRA Section 604, Subsection ( a ) ( 3 ) ( F ), as well as my right to accurate and fair credit reporting. 

FDCPA Violations : Demand for Deletion of Account under 15 USC 1692f : I assert that XXXX Account Number : XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Section 1692f, Subsection ( 1 ), explicitly prohibits the collection of any amount unless expressly authorized by the agreement or permitted by law. I demand immediate deletion of these accounts in accordance with this statute. 

Unauthorized Reporting to Credit Report without Permission : Furthermore, I did not provide permission for XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX to be reported to my credit report. This act violates FDCPA Section 807, Subsection ( 8 ), which disallows communicating false credit information, including the failure to communicate that a disputed debt is under dispute. 

TILA Violation : Reporting Inaccurate Account Status under 15 US Code 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S Code 1681i ( 5 ) : I strongly believe that XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX 's inaccurate reporting of my account status breaches TILA 's commitment to accurate and transparent credit information. Section 1666i outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies, which includes providing accurate and complete information. 
These violations have brought significant distress into my life. I would like to share a personal story of how these inaccuracies and unauthorized inquiries have impacted me emotionally and financially. [ Here, you can provide specific details about how these violations have affected your life, such as difficulties in obtaining loans, emotional stress, missed opportunities, etc. ] In light of the aforementioned violations, I kindly request the following actions be taken : Enforce the legal provisions under FCRA, FDCPA, and TILA to address the violations by the involved creditors. 
Request the immediate removal of the unverified accounts from my credit report, as per my rights as a consumer. 
I appreciate your attention to this matter and your commitment to upholding consumer rights. I look forward to a swift resolution and the restoration of accurate credit reporting. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I have called Citizens customer service twice and was told they couldn't help me nor could they give me a phone number to an office that could. If the taxes are paid within 90 days there is a discount on inheritance tax in XXXX Inheritance tax is the reason i need the letter so I can pay the amount due. I also explained that in the letter.

I followed the instructions and faxed my ID and my questions to the fax number I was given.

I have not received any response from the bank to my questions. Each time I was told someone would get back to me, but no one ever did. After the third statement arrived with the notice the account was overdrawn, I was simply told not to worry, the matter was being looked into and the bank wouldn't be trying to recoup the money from our company. That was not a response but an excuse for not responding. I WANT INFORMATION how this ever could have happened in the first place.

They asked if I opened an account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs and I informed them that I did not.

After that unsolicited call, I independently found the phone number to Marcus by Goldmans Sachs and contacted them a few hours later onXX/XX/XXXX. The customer service representative sent me to their fraud department. The representative at their fraud department refused to provide any information regarding the fraudulent account, such as when the account was opened and how they verified the identity of the individual who fraudulently opened this account. I told them that any account opened in my name ( at this point, I provided them with my personal information ) was fraudulent and that I've never opened accounts with Marcus by Goldman Sach. I asked if the account has been closed, but the representative refused to provide that confirmation, saying "" our policy is to not provide that information. '' I was then told by that representative that any fraudulent account would be closed and I would receive a confirmation letter confirming that the account was closed. 

I never received any confirmation letter confirming the account was closed.

05/13/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Last summer, I followed a professional baseball team around the country to watch their games in many cities. I purchased all of my tickets ahead of time through XXXX so that I was guaranteed quality tickets. Once I procured tickets, I then purchased flight tickets and hotel reservations. 

I purchased tickets through XXXX for XXXX events that took place within about a XXXX day period. That allowed me to book all of my travel arrangements. 

The first XXXX events that I went to with those XXXX tickets granted me access to the venue but were in far inferior seats than what XXXX advertised and sold to me. I paid premium prices for premium tickets but then was provided far inferior seats. When I called XXXX from the event I was at, they said they would take care of it. When I followed up the next day, I was told it would go through their process but it would be taken care of. XXXX days later, I went to the second event with XXXX tickets that were not what I was sold. 

XXXX told me that the tickets are sold from other consumers and they are just the middle-man. However, XXXX also has a guarantee that if the tickets are not as described, they will either refund the money or provide better seats. XXXX did neither. At that point, I couldn't continue spending XXXX of dollars for travel and not know of the quality of seats, if any, that I would have. So I had to purchase tickets for those events elsewhere even though I had XXXX more events of XXXX tickets. 

XXXX told me that I should post my future tickets up for sales on their website ( which they make money off of ) in hopes of getting my money back since I didn't want to continue taking the risk of their tickets being inaccurate. I explained that if they didn't sell or sold for less than what I paid, I would be getting ripped off again, and it wasn't fair to me. 

After numerous calls/emails, I was offered XXXX XXXX reduction on my most recent transaction. Obviously, that wasn't fair to me. After speaking to supervisors and sending in paperwork, I was offered a {$500.00} future credit for the website and reversing my most recent change ( {$760.00} ). The {$760.00} was reversed, but I refused both the XXXX XXXX reduction and {$500.00} future credit since my charges were for over {$500.00}. 

XXXX supervisors from XXXX eventually said that I needed to have my credit card company file disputes for the transactions. The supervisors, who claimed they were the highest level of support that a consumer could talk to, had their hands tied. They were only able to do what was already offered ( XXXX XXXX reduction, reversal of most recent charge ), and if that wasn't fair to me, I would have to file disputes with my credit card company. 

When I first tried to file disputes with my credit card company, as the merchant requested, the credit card company ( Chase ) refused to open the claims. They said that since I accessed the event, nothing was owed. I explained that the only way I knew that my tickets were not what was sold to me was by accessing the event. They said it didn't matter. Now, when I have followed up with Chase about this, the supervisor used a different excuse as to why they won't open a dispute ( even though the merchant insisted that is what I needed to do ), telling me this time that it was too long after the transaction, so I would have to provide information directly from the merchant. That isn't my fault that they failed to adhere to their responsibilities originally and aren't holding the merchant to their guarantee of refunding the tickets or providing better tickets if the ones provided aren't what were advertised. 

I am stuck between XXXX companies. One, XXXX, claims to be trying to do the right thing but can't unless disputes are filed. The other, Chase Bank, has refused to do their responsibilities to their consumers.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,92694,,Consent provided,Web,05/13/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8996760.0

This situation, which I believe to be a result of a data breach or severe mismanagement of personal information, is not only alarming but poses a risk to my financial security and privacy. In light of this, and my immediate need to address potential repercussions, I am seeking monetary damages to hire a private investigator and obtain necessary insurances. 

Narrative of Events : Upon receiving the letter from Wells Fargo regarding an account associated with a name I no longer use, I was deeply concerned about the integrity of my personal data and the security of my financial information. This incident is particularly troubling as I am in the midst of planning significant financial activities, including a capital raise and real estate transactions, necessitating a clear and secure financial standing. 

Violations and Requested Resolution : Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) : The potential exposure of my personal data suggests a breach of GLBA, which mandates financial institutions to protect the confidentiality and security of consumer information. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Should this issue affect my credit report, it would violate the FCRA 's requirements for accurate and fair credit reporting. 

Given these concerns, I request the CFPB to : Initiate a thorough investigation into the handling and protection of my personal and financial data by Wells Fargo, specifically identifying how my former name came to be associated with recent communications. 
Mandate Wells Fargo to provide monetary damages sufficient to hire a private investigator to assess the extent of the data breach or mismanagement and to secure necessary insurances that would protect my financial interests moving forward. 
Ensure Wells Fargo takes immediate steps to secure my data against further unauthorized access or breaches and to correct any inaccuracies in their records or on my credit report stemming from this issue. 
Conclusion : The receipt of this letter under a former name and the potential it signifies for a data breach or significant mismanagement has caused me considerable distress and concern for my financial future. It is imperative that this matter is resolved promptly and thoroughly, with Wells Fargo held accountable for any lapses in data security or management. I trust the CFPB will act swiftly to address this complaint and facilitate the necessary financial restitution for me to mitigate the potential impacts of this situation.

02/13/25,Credit card,Store credit card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Dear CFPB, I am submitting this formal complaint regarding a fraudulent credit account that was opened in my name with XXXX XXXX  Card Services. Upon discovering this fraudulent activity, I disputed the account. As a result, XXXXXXXX XXXX confirmed in writing that the account would be closed and removed from my credit report. 

Despite this confirmation, I have continued to receive multiple emails and phone calls attempting to collect on this fraudulent debt. Each time, I have provided the attached letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX verifying that the account was fraudulent and should not be pursued. However, I am now facing legal action from an attorney representing this debt, who is threatening to garnish my wages. 

The following laws are applicable to my case and should be enforced : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ) Ensures the accuracy and privacy of consumer credit reports. Under the FCRA : I have the right to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report ( 1681i ).

The credit reporting agencies and data furnishers are required to remove fraudulent accounts once they are identified ( 1681c-2 ). 
The continued reporting of a fraudulent account may be considered a violation of my rights.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. ) Protects consumers from abusive debt collection practices. Under the FDCPA : Debt collectors can not attempt to collect a debt that is not valid ( 1692e ).

It is illegal to use false or misleading representations in connection with debt collection ( 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) ).

The threat of wage garnishment on a fraudulent debt may be considered an unfair and deceptive practice ( 1692f ).

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 et seq. ) Prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) in the financial marketplace. The continued attempts to collect a fraudulent debt may violate the CFPAs prohibition against unfair collection practices.

Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) Criminalizes identity theft and fraudulent use of another persons identifying information. Since this account was fraudulently opened in my name, I request that this matter be further investigated as a potential identity theft violation. 
I am attaching all relevant documentation, including the letter from XXXX XXXX  confirming the accounts closure. I request that the CFPB take immediate action to : Ensure that this fraudulent account is permanently removed from my credit report. 
Stop all collection attempts and legal action against me regarding this debt. 
Investigate and enforce penalties against any party violating federal laws. 
Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide information on the next steps to resolve this matter. I appreciate your prompt attention to this urgent issue.",,"CLGF Holdco 1, LLC",IL,60438,,Consent provided,Web,02/21/25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,12050599.0

The first I learned of this was when I got a late statement from them through the mail, which included a late fee and interest charges.

A few days later I received another notice from Bank of America to say they had reported me to the credit reporting agencies, and also had lowered the credit limit on my credit card. I again called the customer service department and requested they reverse the errorneous late payment report to the credit reporting agencies, and reinstate the credit limit on the card. They indicated they would not reinstate the previous credit limit without me resubmitting my full financial information.

Despite following all verification requests from Wells Fargo, I have encountered repeated delays, inconsistent instructions, and what appears to be unfair treatment. 

After submitting my application with all required details, I was informed that it was denied due to an inability to verify my identity. Wells Fargo requested that I fax two forms of address verification, which I did. After not receiving a response for over a week, I called again, and they then requested that I also fax a government-issued ID, which I promptly submitted.

Another week passed with no response. When I followed up, I was told that my faxed ID was too dark to be viewed, though my previously submitted documents were accepted without issue. I then went to a different UPS store to resend the fax. Again, I received no response. 

A few days later, when I called for an update, the agentwho was noticeably impatientclaimed that I still needed to resubmit two address verification documents and my ID. I explained that I had already done so multiple times, but the agent simply repeated that my documents were missing. Frustrated by the inconsistency, I requested to speak with a manager.

I was transferred to another representative, who told me that if I went to a Wells Fargo local branch and had them submit the fax on my behalf, that would resolve the issue. I followed this instruction and went to a Wells Fargo branch to submit the documents again. However, when I called today for an update, I was again told that my ID was too dark to be processed. 

At this point, it feels as though Wells Fargo is intentionally creating obstacles to deny my application. My credit history and income fully meet their requirements, yet they continue to provide vague or contradictory reasons for rejection. I believe I am being unfairly discriminated against, as there is no reasonable explanation for these repeated document requests and delays. 

I request that CFPB investigate Wells Fargos handling of my application and ensure that I receive a fair and transparent evaluation.

I had not used them since XXXX of XXXX!!! When I saw the charge I immediately called chase and cancelled my card of which they gave me a condition credit of {$410.00}. Then the overseas claims dept completely took XXXX wrong information and said I never had any relationship w this merchant and I was floored when I read that. Chase over turned the credit and took my money. I then stormed into a branch demanding to get this issue fixed whereas once again it was conditionally credited but then about XXXX weeks later it was once again going to be taken out as they said the info I provided showed it was authorized and I was floored once again. I took out all funds so my money could not be stolen again. I marched into the bank again about XX/XX/XXXX or so explaining to the branch manager of which he called and attempted to explain the situation. Note : this merchant did not send the XXXX page of paperwork which clearly showed the only card on file to be used in the event monies were owed or over due was a CREDIT card. I also had sent that page showed my signature and the only card but chase can not can not seem to get a grasp on this very simplistic fact. Now my acct is over drafted for {$430.00} I believe until I can once again show them this merchant intentionally did not send the page showing the Only card to be used. I made cash payments and a credit card payment and ( XXXX ) authorized payment to this merchant in XXXX wherein they or he saved my card number of my debit card and then alleging there was still money owed 6 months later ran that debit card knowing fully that it was not authorized and was illegal. This is a simple case of Chase having incompetent people over seas working for them. I have a signed Document showing a credit card on file with my signiture which was the only one to be used if monies were owed at a later date or werent paid. I presented that piece of paper, the one the merchant forgot to send with the other XXXX page agreement and it seems they still need to scratch their heads to figure this out. Iam so stressed and spent hours attempting to fix this XXXX XXXX problem of my money being stolen from me and the bank being so incompetent to fix it or get it back. The only assumption I can draw from this is either the claims department overseas is completely incompetent which I believe they are as the lady I spoke w initially on or about XX/XX/XXXX for the initially complaint that wrote I had no relationship w or knew nothing about this merchant, that started this whole mess and or the Merchant has a bank acct a Business Acct with Chase and his acct is much larger than mine monetarily so they are siding with him. It makes absolutely XXXX sense and any high school or middle school young adult acting as a claims go between person could figure this out. No signed ir verbal agreement w my debt card on file then = no authorization especially XXXX a year later the card is used.

This morning, I called in and proceeded to instruct an agent whose name I do not recall, who told me XXXX had misinformed me and indicated that I would have to transfer the funds out of the account and get the account to a {$0.00} balance before they could close the account. I disconnected the call and called another agent, named XXXX. XXXX echoed the same new instructions. 

I proceeded to initiate a wire transfer to a merchant with whom I have already signed a contract with to sell me a concerted campervan in the amount of {$130000.00}.

Also that is isnt that I want or expect anything out of the ordinary. Initially, receiving a pre-approval for an American Express credit card was a moment of immense excitement for me. It represented not just a financial tool, but a lifeline during a challenging time. Everything started smoothly - I even requested additional cards without issue. The problems began when an alert for unusual activity was triggered due to my brother, an authorized user, linking his XXXX to the card. In an attempt to resolve this, I contacted customer service but unfortunately failed the authentication process. This was partly due to having the representative on mute as I was in a public place. Following this, I was directed to use XXXX for identity verification. Despite my comfort with technology, this process was fraught with difficulties, taking three days of back-and-forth communication and ultimately ending in another failure. The emotional toll of this experience has been overwhelming. My account is currently frozen, and I am faced with additional contingent steps. Despite the fact that my home address, listed on my driver 's license, matches all the cards ' addresses and there has been no unusual activity or transactions, the resolution seems distant. I understand the need for security measures, but the lack of flexibility and understanding in my situation is disheartening. I intend to fulfill my financial obligations and pay what I owe. However, it is crucial to highlight the emotional rollercoaster this process has been, especially for someone with limited credit history. My experience with American Express has been far from what I expected, and I believe it's important for potential customers, particularly those new to credit, to be aware of these potential challenges. I hope that this complaint will be taken seriously and that American Express will review and improve their customer verification processes and customer service approach.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,NV,89104,,Consent provided,Web,02/24/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8415199.0

I had a {$50.00} stop payment placed on my account for a payment to XXXX. I'm not even certain if was for a XXXX. Anyhow, they did not properly explain, and/or document the changes "" Stop payment '' ten plus years ago. 

As to-date I've had 2 or more {$50.00} payments returned by XXXX XXXX ; I was also assessed two or more {$50.00} NSF fee by AMEX. Puzzled by the returned payments and frustrated by the fees I started to dig into what's going on. XXXX XXXX has returned the two {$50.00} payments as of XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. I guess due to this {$50.00} stop payment from 10+ years ago. Still unsure how it popped up. 

When i called AMEX to ask for forgiveness and the fee waived, I was told its XXXX XXXX 's fault. You need to contact your bank ; we will not waive the fees. About a solid month ago I also asked for the annual fee to be waived for me. I was laid off by XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX after 15 years of service. I considered enrolling in the payment plan to help people but declined after i found out it negatively impacts your credit. I begged and pleaded with the two reps i spoke to that day to waive the enrollment fee, and the first NSF fee. I was strong armed on the phone with Solid NO 's, this is our policy, no forgiveness, the fees are valid. 

Look, I understand, having worked for corporate America. Those fees help your stock price. My first manager would scold me for waiving the {$20.00} phone fee. When I worked my first 3 years in the call center. I felt too much for those people, you could hear the hurt in their voice. This {$20.00} was coming out of something in their monthly budget, part of the light bill, groceries, gas for the week. It was the least I could do.

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter that Citi would close our accounts automatically within 60 days. I called Citi and Citi told me that the balance on the account would be refunded me within 30 days after closure. They stated that I would be receiving a final statement in the mail. I was also told that if their review had determined that the checks wrote to me should not have been deposited, they would return that money to the people that had written the checks. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I received a {$25.00} check from Citi with "" Closeout Disbursement '' written in the memo line. This was the money that we deposited as an initial deposit into the account and did not include the {$1400.00} in checks made out to my husband that were deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We reached out to the three people that wrote my husband checks on XX/XX/XXXX and they informed us that none of them had received the money back either. 

This means that as of XX/XX/XXXX, Citi is holding {$1400.00} of funds from checks written out to my husband. Even though Citi closed the account, they did not return the money to either the people that made out the checks or my husband, the person that the checks were made out to. 

Since the checks cleared the banks from these three people, Citi is clearly holding on to this money and a search online seems to indicate that Citi had done this to hundreds or thousands of others. It feels like Citi is trying to steal money that does not rightfully belong to them. I've lost trust in putting money in banks.

I tried to report it but an agent told me that I had to wait until it was done pending so under those directions I did and that resulted in more and more time for fraudulent transactions. Remember my phone and wallet is both stolen so everything of my personal information is in the hands of another person. I report these abundance of fraudulent transactions and get prompted a new account, new card, new login. The fraudulent amount was for {$6000.00} roughly. I get my money transferred from my now old that was accessed into my new one ( around {$1400.00} ) and issued my adjustment for my other charges. My ID was stolen in wallet ( previously ) and I called Navy Federal and the customer service representative recommended a cashier check to a third party for they could be able to withdraw it if I wanted to access it without an ID.. ( my new card was in the mail ). I initiated the cashier check and had my payee go to the navy federal branch to pick it up but she was directed that I needed to be there with my ID ( the customer service representative told me nothing of me needing my ID or else I wouldnt have even did the cashier check ) so the woman at the actual branch says I need to call and cancel that check and ask for another service ( I forgot the name ) that allows me to give permission for the payee to withdraw it without me I believe. So I call and the woman is able to cancel it through the phone but said she couldnt do the option I asked for. After that phone call I tried to log into my app off my XXXX and it would not let me sign in saying I had to call the help line. I call and is told my account is closing and my cancelled cashier check that was suppose to return my funds of {$6300.00} is on hold.

My account shouldnt be closing. I was literally on the phone with representatives so how could my account be closing and everything I have said and done has been truthful and verified since I am the account holder. If I was fully told that it ran this risk I wouldnt have even initiated a cashier check since I didnt even know what one was prior to talking to the customer service representative.

She had received these bonds as a baby and, before going to the bank, signed them as required. 

Prior to this, she had confirmed on Bank of America 's website that the bank cashes savings bonds for account holders. My daughter has held a joint account with me, XXXX XXXX, since XX/XX/XXXX, and my wife and I have been long-time customers of Bank of America for over 20 years. 

However, when she arrived at the branch, the bank refused to cash the bonds, citing an internal policy that requires an account holder to have been a customer for at least three years before being eligible to cash savings bonds. This policy was not disclosed on their website, nor was she informed of it when she opened her account. My daughter left the bank in tears. 

To resolve the issue, I left work and accompanied her back to the bank. The bank still refused to cash the bonds because my wife 's namenot minewas also listed on them. XXXX XXXX, a bank representative, reiterated that their system prevents the cashing of savings bonds for newer account holders, and our only options were to bring my wife in person or mail the bonds to the U.S. Treasury.

Following this, I attempted to submit the bonds to the Treasury. However, I discovered that because my daughter had already signed them, we could no longer complete the process via mail.

This situation forced my wife, who suffers from severe XXXX  triggered by conflict and interactions with strangers, to leave work and accompany us to the bank.

I have enjoyed a credit account with yout company for many years. During the course of our business association, I have honored and respected my account agreement to the fullest. I appreciate how wonderful your service has always been. 
Unfortunately, 2 years ago, I was in a financial dilemma due to job loss and multiple health issues. As a result some of my payments to you were delayed. Because your account with me is extremely important I managed to borrow the money to cover the late payments. I paid those payments 30 days late on three occasions over a nine-month period but I made sure to fulfill my obligation to ensure that your company suffered no loss. 
I am thankful and appreciative for the years of positive credit history that I have obtained through your company but now those 3 late marks on my credit reports are causing me tremendous stress. I am trying to move up to a better paid position at my work, but the negative remarks are hurting my efforts. 
This is where my "" Goodwill Request '' comes in. I desperately need this promotion and I would be extremely appreciative if you would please complete a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and fax it to the credit bureaus to remove those entries. 
The credit bureaus have advised me that they will report anything as instructed to by you, but they need to have that instruction in writing. I beg that you may help me and take into consideration how good of a customer I have been and how long I have had an account with you. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope youll approve my request.

04-08-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Delay in processing application,"I applied for a Wells Fargo Choice Privileges Master Card  on XX/XX/2024. I get an email that is in review and if they approve it, I will receive one in 7 days. I am already a Wells Fargo customer with two credit cards with them. I even opened a checking account with them last year. I closed it after they lied to me. They froze my online access and when I called them to find out why they asked questions if I visited another country and tried to access my account. They wanted me to go into a Wells Fargo branch and show them my ID so they could unfreeze it. I went to the location in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they said i needed an appointment. So, I went to the cashier and withdrew almost all of my money. I asked them how if I can't access my account online and you need to see my ID to unlock my account can you give me cash without seeing my ID because I need to make an appointment. Just days prior there was a text I received pretending to be Wells Fargo Fraud department. It actually was. After the visit with that branch the next day I went to the branch off XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX They said they take walk ins, and I don't need an appointment, The lady called the number and verified to them who I was by my ID and they made me change my login and password there. NO ONE Breached my account on my end as I checked. I do my own XXXX security. Another person there for the same reason as I proved it was not on my end and Wells Fargo failed to report to the Federal Government the breach then. I opened a no interest credit card with them much later after this. So now we are caught up to the XXXX XXXX application. I had to call the number to find out they wanted me to go to a branch and give them a government ID and two documents such as utility bills and etc. They never supplied this info on why my application was being held up and would complete deny it without providing me this information if I didn't take the initiative. I only have 7 business days. I filled a XXXX complaint on XXXX and it was assigned to a person named XXXX I believe. I told them I am well established with them and that they have no problems sending a statement to my house and taking my money. My license is linked to a Private Security License and License to Carry ID 's and they do not need certain information on my DL such as the audit number and such and they don't need copies of my utilities with my account numbers and such. I didn't need that when I got my MasterCard from them or Dillard 's card, which my Dillard 's card is the oldest. With all the data breaches to include the one they never reported the only way my other 3rd party accounts stay secure is to ensure that they never get them. So, I played their little game and went back to the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX XXXX on Thursday XX/XX/2024, at XXXX. A XXXX lady helped me. I told her what I needed her to do was fax this info in and because I had scratched out information such as amount due, due date, account number she wouldn't do anything at all. The more I talked the more attitude she had like well what do you want me to do about it. The account holder name, address, as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  wasn't scratched out. So basically, they refused to accept what they sent me to do and wanted while failing to disclose exactly that during the application process nor in the email given. To be specific they had no intentions of giving an honest chance of credit before I even filled out the application. When I gave this lady my cards and told her to close my accounts, she gave them back to me and told me to call the numbers on the back. Wells Fargo is a useless bank with useless people they employ that it amazes me how they are staying afloat if they aren't being subsidized by the government because none of this is how you keep customers. I still haven't heard a peep from Wells Fargo about this new incident that already lowered my credit score and I find what they have done possibly violates parts of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. I think my bank account was open for 3 weeks before I got that text which I found that also quite odd.

Complainant Details : Name : XXXX XXXX Credit Card Number : XXXX Date of Incident : XX/XX/XXXX Amount in Dispute : {$12000.00} Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/XXXX, I transferred {$12000.00} to my Chase business credit card account. This transfer was intended to ensure I would be able to use the business credit card and that all business expenses would be properly deducted from my business account. However, Chase has placed this amount on hold for a "" security review '' and stated that the funds will not be released until the XXXX of XXXX without further justification. 

Impact on My Business : The hold has prevented me from processing critical business transactions and caused damage to vendor relationships due to delayed payments. 
It has resulted in overall disruption to business operations, potentially affecting long-term business stability. 

I have contacted Chase customer service multiple times to request an expedited review and release of the funds. Despite my efforts, the issue remains unresolved, and Chase has not provided a satisfactory explanation or resolution. 

Desired Resolution : Immediate release of the {$12000.00} held by Chase. Audit of Chase business practices in that regard. Assurance that similar issues will not occur in the future. 
I believe that Chase 's actions are against consumer rights and represent a highly despicable business practice. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that financial institutions like Chase uphold their obligations to their customers. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue promptly.

05/17/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Hello so I went into my local chase branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and made a {$920.00} deposit into my checking account. I did deposit a lot of change like dollar bills, fives, twenties, a couple fifties and the rest in XXXX dollar bills which I've done before but this time I think there was a problem with XXXX of the bills getting stuck because the ATM I was usuing started making a very loud noise and it took much longer than usual to process the bills. Unfortunately this caused the ATM to give me a transaction error, then printed out a receipt which I have proof of and told me to make sure my deposit did go through which it did not and my money didn't come back out to me! Also this completely made the ATM machine unusable so I thought for sure they would see my money was stuck in there. I called the number it said to for help since the associates there said there was nothing they could do to help me. I called this number while inside the chase and told them everything that happened and they said they would issue me the money as missing credit that I received on XX/XX/XXXX and from then on I thought everything was resolved but then a month later on XX/XX/XXXX they reversed the credit. I called the support line again and they said I had no proof of depositing the money into the ATM even though I did and had already submitted all the proof they asked for so I told them something isn't right please submit another claim for me my money is in that ATM and if they could check the transaction logs or whoever worked at that bank and fixed that ATM had to of reported it on the logs that it was over in money however they told me they couldn't make a new claim for me only reopen my original claim so I never received my credit again. Months passed it was now XX/XX/XXXX, and they finally reached out to me again and told me there was no reports on this ATM being over in money and that they can't locate what happened to my deposit, so I'm very desperate at this point and I just go into my chase branch and speak to their manager XXXX, she told me she had only been back in office for one month because she was on pregnancy leave and that she would help me try to get my money back so she called everyone I had already contacted and said she wanted to escalate my claim AGAIN and she spoke with the manager of claims department and asked them to look into again for me, so for the 3rd time I was told they would reach out to me again and they eventually did on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with the head of the claims department and he said nothing was found again so this time I said I wanted to report this as theft because now I was suspicious that whoever went to fix that ATM or did the logging stole the money and just didn't report it because how else could they not find it? So they told me I have to call the branch this happened at so I finally able to get ahold of XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and told her I believe this was employee negligence or theft so I want to report this so she said she will submit this to the executive 's office and it's going to take time and they will have to do a full investigation, MANY months passed and no one ever reached back out to me so I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to get an update then she gave me the number of the person working on my case which I believe now this was the wrong department it should've been reported to the fraud department because this guy ( couldn't understand the name heavy accent ) told me the same thing they all said that nothing was found, I don't even believe they ever looked into this situation even then I pleaded with them my proof that I had a coworker who was with me that day and watched me deposit this money and the error receipt telling me to make sure this deposit went through and they could clearly see into my checking account that the money never did. I know much time has passed since then but this whole situation was taking a huge toll on my mental health and I all I could do when I thought of it was cry out of frustration, I finally found this site that could possibly help me or help others in this situation so it never happens again and maybe I can actually get better resolve for this.

I believe that my recent experience with Wells Fargo reflects significant issues in their customer service and resolution processes, and I seek your assistance in resolving this matter. 

In XXXX, I received a notification that my account was being closed due to a random address verification requirement.

This discrepancy resulted in delays and significant inconvenience on my part. 

Furthermore, despite being assured that I would receive a refund of {$420.00} within XXXX business days, I have yet to receive the promised check. Upon inquiry, I was informed that my correct address was not on file, despite it being used for the initial communication. This failure on Wells Fargo 's part to maintain accurate customer information is deeply concerning. 

To compound matters, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, instructing me to complete a form titled "" Replacement of missing cashiers check - Reference PMB account '', which mandates notarization. It is unacceptable that I am now expected to undergo additional steps, including notarization, due to Wells Fargo 's mishandling of my information. 

It has been XXXX  days since the promised refund, and I am still without my money. The inconvenience and frustration caused by Wells Fargo 's errors are unacceptable. As a consumer, I expect transparency, accountability, and timely resolution of issues from financial institutions.

I told the bank that someone hacked one of my emails and linked my debit card to make purchases on an App called XXXX and another transaction called XXXX XXXX. 
I told them I did not authorize these transactions, I don't use that app at all and I have no idea why they charged me those amounts. 

I asked them politely to recover my money by filing a dispute for unauthorized transactions because this is fraud and we're dealing with fraudulent transactions. 

They filed a dispute and submitted the case to the internal department, within 1 hour or so I got an automatic email from Chime saying : Based on our investigation, we have concluded no error occurred. Therefore, no funds will be credited to your account and this claim is considered closed. 

I contacted the bank again multiple times after getting rejected over and over again and receiving an automatic email sent by XXXX with the same final decision, I found out my case was not being reviewed by a real agent other than a machine which is one I was getting automatic emails with a final decision denying my disputes over and over. 

I spoke to several agents and supervisors, but no one has been able to solve this matter. They keep sending the same emails and no evidence, no explanation, nothing at all. They just want to deny my disputes and not refund my money from the merchant. They were also rude and very disrespectful over the phone.

First of all, paypal limits user accounts accusing violation of acceptable use policy. They sent email saying our accounts are permanently limited and after 180 days, we will get emails regarding our account situation and withdraw of money in the balance. As per my case and a lot happened to other users, we dont get email as they promised prior after 180 days of limitation. Instead, after certain amounts of time, we receive email that paypal can take recovery loss from our balances not mentioning a specific amount. 
In my case, my account was restricted on XXXX XXXX and I didnt receive any email from paypal during or after 180 days. Only on XX/XX/XXXX, i received email that paypal can take recovery loss and i checked my account on same day and my balance was same. But on XX/XX/XXXX, all the balances in my account which is XXXX $ was taken as paypal recovery loss. I used PayPal with my real informations and I never had dispute over transactions. First off, this kind of dishonest financial institutions are risky for benefits and financial guarantee for public consumers. I acknowledge that as per their terms and regulations that we sign when we open account, that they can take recovery charges. However, from their side, theyre not open with how much percentage of balance they can take or they dont inform you via email about how much money they took from your account or for which specific reason. Moreover, they dont send instruction email after 180 days as they promised. Customer has the right to know for which specific reason, they money was taken and to argue until he feels justified. 

Second report : I found out that someone was putting random fake SSNs and Tax IDs and PayPal system is accepting them. You should take action immediately as it endangers public safety and wellbeing. Secondly, if Paypal gets suspicious over a transaction, it should report to respective authorities, not by itself keeping the money illegally without informing authorities.

05-03-2025,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Subject : Widespread Violation of XXXX  and XXXX Debit Card Surcharge Rules with No Enforcement To Whom It May Concern, I am submitting this complaint due to the widespread and growing practice of merchants adding illegal surcharges or so-called convenience fees when I use a debit card at the point of sale or online. This violates XXXX and XXXX  publicly published rules, which explicitly prohibit surcharges on debit card transactionseven when the transaction is run as credit. The problem is rampid and getting worse, even utility companies are doing it. 

Despite multiple complaints submitted directly to XXXX and XXXX, including merchant names, dates, and receipts, they have taken no action and do not respond. These networks continue to promote these protections publicly while making no effort to enforce them. It creates a false sense of consumer protection and enables systemic abuse by merchants. 

As a consumer, I have no recourse. Banks refer me back to XXXX, who ignore me. Merchants refuse to remove the fees, claiming theyre convenience fees, a deliberate mislabeling to avoid scrutiny. 

For example, my trash service provider charges a {$1.00} fee when I attempt to pay my bill online using a debit card, giving me no fee-free option unless I mail a physical check or allow ACH pull from my bankneither of which is practical or secure for everyone.

I am requesting the CFPB investigate : Why XXXX and XXXX do not enforce their own published rules. 

Whether the use of deceptive convenience fees to bypass surcharge rules is a violation of federal consumer protection laws. 

Why merchants are allowed to charge fees on debit transactions despite contractual card network rules that prohibit them.

11/13/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I applied for an Aspire Credit Card, which was promoted as having no annual or monthly fee. After about 12 months of use of the card, Aspire apparently changed its fee structure and started charging me a $ XXXX fee, which I did not notice until today. I carried a balance on the card until paying it off in full earlier this fall, so did not notice the extra $ XXXX in charges. 

Aspire invited me several times to sign up for XXXX of statements and notices, but I prefer paper notices, so I never opted-in to XXXX 

Despite this, XXXX apparently never notified me in writing of its new fee structure. I asked when they mailed me notice of the new fee, and they told me I was sent an "" email notice '' in early 2023, But if such an email was sent, I never saw it. I recieve hundreds of emails a day, so if such an email was sent, I did not see it. 

As such, I have apparently been charged $ XXXX for at least XXXX months, without notice to me or my consent to such charges. I would like to be refunded for any of these charges that were placed on my card. In a phone call with customer service, I was told that the $ XXXX maintenance fee is "" automatically added '' after the card account is open for a year. I do not recall any disclosure of this escalating fee structure. 

When I called to cancel my account, the first XXXX customer service representatives told me that a request to cancel my account would take "" 45 days '' or "" XXXX business days '' to process, and that the $ XXXX fee would be deducted during that time. Only after I identified myself as an attorney did the customer service rep ( the XXXX one I spoke with ) agree to cancel my account more quickly, and to remove the existing {$10.00} balance ( XXXX monthly maintenance fees ). 

This undisclosed increase in fees and XXXX cancellation period seems extremely sneaky to me, and since XXXXspire markets itself as a "" credit recovery '' credit card, I suspect Aspire is deliberately taking advantage of unwary consumers. I signed up for the Aspire card because I recently exited a personal bankruptcy, and Aspire was the only "" XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card that did not charge monthly or annual fees.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Called US Bank back since the bonus had not posted and I was told that I was ineligible because I had an open checking account with US Bank before. After mentioning that Id never gotten a US bank promotion or ever had an account I was told that they did open two for me back in 2022 that made me ineligible even though I could never access these alleged accounts. 

I attempted to open a checking account with US Bank for the first time in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I encountered issues during the process. Despite receiving requests to fund an account, I couldn't proceed as the funding page consistently resulted in errors, prompting me to call customer support. 

Upon contacting customer support, I was informed that my application was on hold pending an address verification. I complied with their request to fax a picture of my ID, but after a week of no response, I followed up. I was then told that my application was under review. When I asked to simply create a login since I was being prompted to set up funding information, I was informed that I had to wait as there was nothing to attach a login to. 

Now, more than a year later, after meeting the requirements and being assured of my eligibility, I'm being informed that I don't qualify due to having two accounts in the past. This information would have been crucial to know before being told I qualified and before meeting the requirements. As evidence that I never had an active US Bank checking account, I'm attaching two emails from 2022 stating that my account could not be opened.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,GA,30022,,Consent provided,Web,05-07-2024,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,8937944.0

I also sent this letter to my credit card company Synchrony XXXX. The problem with XXXX is that when I put everything in writing then I get a response back in writing that says due to the nature of your question you will have to call to speak with someone regarding your questions about your dispute. XXXX states each time I call that all calls are recorded. Here is the problem : Everytime I call I am told different information from a different person. Not XXXX phone call is consistent with the current info. related to my dispute. I can not ever reach XXXX person and be able to get back to that same person. I am promised that I will get a response from the merchant ( XXXX ) regarding my letter. After dozens of attempts XXXX is giving me the runaround and will not tell me what the XXXX response was to my letter. My dispute with Synchrony XXXX has been opened and closed several dozen times over the course of almost XXXX years. Each time the dispute is reopened XXXX says wait XXXX days to hear back. I have called several times only a week after the dispute is opened and it has been closed within a week well before the XXXX days and I am not notified of it, this has happened so many times I have lost track maybe XXXX times. The person on the phone is always a new person and each one tells me different information none of which I am able to hold them responsible or tracked in writing. I have been patient and there is only a wall with no communication. I can not build a written paper track with Synchrony XXXX and the people over the phone at Synchrony can not be held responsible as I can not reach the same person ever again, always getting a new person who does not have all the information regarding my dispute. After so much effort and work with this dispute I have worked twice as hard as what I am asking for. I just want my money back. False advertisement ruined my chance at building my porches on my house. My house design is ruined because of XXXX XXXX XXXX advertising a picture of a product and XXXX taking so long to make it right with me. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX to XXXX  XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Synchrony XXXX : Misrepresentation Product Not as Advertised. To whom it concerns : In response to the XXXX letter I received from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. In your letter you state XXXX advised you that they contacted me to resolve this issue, they have not and they will not be honest or come to terms with me. They would not let me speak with the owner and had to go through a girl who was not forthright nor honest with me. I am not in agreement and am still asking for this dispute to be credited back to me. I am not paying for something I did not order. I made the purchase with XXXX credit cards, XXXX for XXXX and XXXX for XXXX for the full amount totaling XXXX In XXXX when I disputed the amount with both credit cards XXXX XXXX did not dispute the XXXX half for {$7500.00} or ask for anything back so XXXX sent me my refund of {$7500.00}. None of the product was returned based on the half refunded nor did they respond to my dispute with my XXXX card. Now XXXX XXXX is saying that they are waiting for me to contact them to set up a return. Before this they told XXXX they refunded me {$610.00} saying it was worked out but that was unrelated to my dispute and not forthright as it was for something completely different than what I am disputing... it was for a product I ordered for part of my porch package which they did not carry anymore. With the items I ordered for my porch package I can not send any of the items back as the builders were forced to use them because I did not have any more money or time to purchase something else on the spot. XXXX XXXX  are not honest and based on our emails and phone calls they were not willing to make it right with me. They claim I am keeping the remainder of the package but they are not addressing that all the parts ordered go together to make a complete design and look. They do not understand that they ruined my Double Porch design and ruined my opportunity of designing my porch the way we intended and initially planned based on their false pictures of their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which look nothing like what we received. We lost our house in a XXXX so understandably there is a shortage of Contractors because of the XXXX and they are extra busy because of the XXXX so they are in a hurry because of the high demand to rebuild all the XXXX homes. We had a contract to build a house with a start and finish date and a budget to stick to. My XXXX Contractor has a contractual responsibility to keep the project moving along and to pay his subcontractors on schedule. I can not send anything back and my porch design is ruined and I had to alter the design because XXXX XXXX did not even send me the correct amount of posts so I was forced to use them on a different part of the home than intended. I ordered my package of : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and built off the look of these posts by adding XXXX brackets, turned balusters, turned spandrels, XXXX running trim, drop finials to make a complete porch posts package from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX in time for the building schedule of the porches getting built. I coordinated with XXXX XXXX on the estimated delivery arrival time before we started the design process. We spent much time working with XXXX at XXXX figuring for measurements based on our house plans and designing each part of the porches from XXXX catalogue of thousands of items to choose from. I don't think anyone realizes what a huge mistake this is on my home being built. The picture they showed of their XXXX XXXX XXXX porch post are much different design than what I received so I called the person who makes them for XXXX XXXX and he explained the pattern has been changed a lot for the reasons they stated, safer to ship by making them bigger in the turned area and they look much more modern than the picture they posted on their website. That being said my whole package will not look as good as I do not have nice looking porch posts. They have a turned look that is not attractive or any resemblance of what their picture website shows and I am not happy with using them but am forced to as I have nothing else to use due to my building contract. I am forced to use the posts as I can not stop the building process. There is a shortage of contractors because of the XXXX. The XXXX contractor could not wait any longer so we were forced to use them differently than intended because there are only XXXX matching posts instead of XXXX. In short we spent over {$15000.00} for a beautiful porch which we did not get so now it is ruined. We had a budget to stick to and a timeline with the contractor. There is no extra money to buy surplus posts. The builders were not going to wait for us to get different posts. XXXX XXXX misrepresented what they were selling by not using a real picture of what they sell, they are using False Advertising and I was forced to use what I had at the moment Because I did not have the time or the extra money to correct this mistake on the spot. XXXX XXXX still owes me the other half of my purchase in the amount of {$7300.00} paid with my XXXX which they have not refunded me for false advertising. XXXX XXXX Website says they do business by following the XXXX XXXX give us a try and we will prove it they say. XXXX XXXX website guarantees the customers happiness. I am not happy and I want the remainder of my purchase refunded to me as I did not get what I paid for and my porches are ruined. It is not my responsibility to pay for something when they send out the wrong product. My porch package was made incorrectly based on XXXX XXXX XXXX false advertising picture and my order was not what it should have been so I need a refund on the other half of my purchase in the amount of {$7300.00} to make up for a full refund.

The bank refuses to provide mailed monthly statements unless customers pay an excessive {$2.00} per statement fee. This effectively forces account holders to either : Accept electronic statements and manage their accounts entirely online, or XXXX in autopay to avoid the fee. 
This practice is unfair, coercive, and potentially in violation of consumer protection laws.

Furthermore, this policy disproportionately affects individuals who lack reliable internet access or prefer traditional banking methods.

I believe this may violate provisions of the Truth in Savings Act ( TISA ) and CFPB regulations regarding transparency and fairness in financial services.

Timeline : Date of Application with Required Documentation Submission : XX/XX/year> Date of Submission Confirmation : XX/XX/year> Date of My Follow-Up : XX/XX/year> Date of Rejection Notice : XX/XX/year> Details of Issue : Despite submitting all required documentation and following the application process, my business account application was rejected without any explanation. Xe.com policies confirm that application approvals for new accounts typically take one day or longer. However, my application sat unprocessed for two full weeks. I followed up on XX/XX/year>, and immediately after inquiring about my application, I received a generic rejection email. 

XX/XX/year> Email Title : Unable to Assist Thank you for being so interested in Xe. Please note that we have reviewed your application and have made the decision to not pursue it further. We apologize for any inconvenience this decision may have caused.

I immediately followed up via email, requesting information for the rejection and asked to understand why I was not given the opportunity to cure any deficiencies. My follow-up request for clarification received no response. 

Potential Regulatory Violations : 1 ) Unfair Business Practices : Xe.com 's failure to provide a reason for the rejection of my application and their lack of response to my inquiries constitutes unfair business practices. The arbitrary rejection without explanation undermines trust and transparency.

2 ) Discrimination and Gatekeeping : As a XXXX XXXX, I am concerned that my application may have been unfairly rejected based on XXXX  practices. Any form of gatekeeping or XXXX  in the account approval process is a serious legal violation. 

3 ) Lack of Transparency and Accountability : Transparency is crucial in financial services. Xe.com 's lack of clear communication and failure to provide a reason for the rejection of my application raises concerns about their accountability. This failure to communicate violates consumer protection standards.

4 ) Consumer Protection Violations : Consumer protection laws are designed to prevent unfair and deceptive business practices. Xe.com 's actions, including the lack of transparency and potential discriminatory practices, violate these laws.

Impact on Business : The arbitrary rejection and lack of communication from Xe.com have significantly impacted my business operations and planning. This includes delays in setting up essential international payment processes crucial for my business activities.

Request for Action : I request an investigation into this matter and a resolution that includes a detailed explanation for the rejection of my application. Furthermore, I request an explanation as to why I was not allowed to cure any deficiencies in my application.

Lastly, I seek assurance that Xe.com will adhere to regulatory standards for transparency, non-discrimination, and fair business practices in their dealings with potential, existing, and previous customers.",,"Ria Envia, LLC",FL,33617,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,06/13/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9247129.0

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I have a XXXX XXXX American Express credit card ending XXXX with a credit limit of {$1000.00}.

I contacted them through their online chat and explained that I was not aware of this increase, nor did I agree to it. I requested a confirmation, but the American Express online chat representative could not validate or confirm that I have agreed to the increase. See attached conversation dated Saturday XX/XX/year>. 
The representative said : "" On XXXX XX/XX/year> we increased the annual fee to {$650.00} '' Then said : "" We've sent you communication last XX/XX/XXXX ''. It is unfair, and I find it highly deceptive trade practice to increase annual fees 50 % greater than my credit limit.

A mattress was delivered Saturday night XX/XX/year>. I left it unopened overnight in a warm room to reach room temperature. 
Opened box Sunday morning XX/XX/year>. Placed plastic-encased mattress atop an old 8 '' full mattress being used as a box spring, which is on top of a full-size metal bed frame. Removed plastic wrap from mattress at XXXX XXXX. At XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> the mattress measured 77 '' long x 53 '' wide x about 9.5 '' high ( height varied from place to place, being lowest at the bottom/foot corners and highest about 1/4th from the top/head ) .An insert that came with the mattress states "" Please allow 48 hours for full recovery ''. 
At XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, 48 hours after plastic was removed, the mattress measured 77 '' long by 54 '' wide by from 8.5 '' to 11 '' high. I did not order a mattress of that size. The mattress I ordered measures 75 '' long x 54 '' wide x 12 '' high. I did not receive what I ordered.

FTC regulations state, under topic Your Rights When You Get Unordered Merchandise, "" By law, companies cant send unordered merchandise to you, then demand payment. That means you never have to pay for things you get but didnt order. You also dont need to return unordered merchandise. Youre legally entitled to keep it as a free gift. '' (
https : //consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products ) Per FTC regulations I do not have to pay for or return the mattress I did not order. I did not receive what I ordered and should not be charged for merchandise I did not receive.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  answered the call. I asked to speak to a supervisor. XXXX then took my call. I explained that I was due a refund per FTC regulations. I was put on hold. When XXXX came back she said they "" can't do a returnless refund '' and said I should dispute the charge with my credit card issuer. 
On XXXX at XXXX I called Ally Credit Card XXXX. At XXXX I spoke to XXXX with the Non-Fraud Engagement Dept . I explained the situation. He filed a "" not as described '' dispute. He said I'd get a letter within 10 business days.

Not having received any letter from Ally Credit Card I called them back on XXXX at XXXX. XXXX took the call. She said the dispute was on pause because they needed more information. She transferred me to XXXX of the Non-fraud Engagement Dept. I gave him the measurements of the mattress and told him that the expanded mattress, which weighs about 50 lbs, is too heavy and cumbersome for me to return ( I'm XXXX and live alone ). I told him I'd taken several photos of the mattress with a measuring tape as proof that my assertions are factual. I asked if he wanted me to submit the photos and he said it wasn't necessary. I told him FTC regulations say I don't have to return or pay for unordered merchandise. XXXX said I'd get something in the mail within 30 business days. 
On XXXX I retrieved my mail from the community mailbox and there were 2 letters from Ally Credit Card dated XXXX. One stated they needed more info. I wasn't sure if that still applied so I called them at XXXX. Despite having chosen the "" disputes '' menu option the person who answered, XXXX, said she was with Customer Service. After I explained the reason for my call she transferred me to Disputes. XXXX took the call. I explained everything yet again. XXXX said the case was "" closed out '' as of the XXXX. I was again grilled about any attempts I'd made to return the mattress. I explained that I'm XXXX, have no one to help me, and can't possibly roll up and compress an expanded mattress so it will fit back in its box. I can't manage a 50lb cumbersome item down the stairs, I can't fit it in my car... it's impossible for me to return it. I told him I wasn't required to return it per FTC regulations. He continued to state that if I didn't attempt to return the mattress ( which I did not order ) my dispute would likely not be approved. He said he would send my case "" up for review ''. He gave me a fax number and a mailing address ( I can use either option ) to submit more information. Instead of complying with FTC regulations ( as other credit card issuers have done for me in the past ), Ally Credit Card is forcing me to go to the time and expense of printing out photos ( they don't provide an email address for submissions ) and then either faxing or mailing my additional info to them. I don't know if I have faxing capabilities anymore so will likely have to mail the documentation, incurring further expense on my end.

DO NOT tell me to contact cashapp support Ive contacted them many times with XXXX resolution. Ive also filed an appeal with XXXX resolution. ALL the information you need is in this complaint. Please dont ask for it again, just read the complaint. 

Below is the narrative from complaint number XXXX. 

On XX/XX/scrub> 2024 someone was able to get onto my cashapp account and move money around my account and able to send money to another account. they sent money to a "" XXXX '' as it appears on the statement but the name changed multiple times between XXXX and XXXX.

This person sent money to the account on 7 occations ranging from $XX/XX/XXXX {$15.00}. I reported all of these transactions to cashapp and they investigated. they began sending the payments back and refunding the money as fradulent. after the 3rd repayment they said that the rest of the transactions were not fraud and that i had violated their terms and conditions. I have chated multiple times to ask why this had happened and why my account had been closed and the person on the chat always says they dont have access to that information. In XXXX i tried to appeal the account closure but after it was reviewed they still have the account closed. they only thing anyone can say is that its closed because i "" violated terms and conditions '' and they send me this huge terms and conditions of cashapp pdf. they can not tell me how or when or what caused the terms violation. I am still owed 4 payments from when the money was sent to a fradulent. They repayed 3 of those but left the rest and said i violated the terms and conditions. How can they determine 3 of them to be fradulent but the rest not fradulent? that makes no sense. the money was all sent to the same person and they deemed it fradulent on the first transactions but said the rest wasnt fradulent. Its very obvious this account was fradulent as the name changed multiple times in a month. Attached is a copy of the statement with the fradulent charges on it from XX/XX/XXXX.

In particular, I have multiple versions of XXXX files downloaded from my account that show conflicting data for the same transactions. These discrepancies appear to have been introduced after the transactions were completed, raising serious concerns about data integrity and potential manipulation. 

I am prepared to provide copies of these records, along with any other relevant information that may assist in your investigation. Please let me know if further details are required. 

Additionally, I would like to outline the pattern of discrepancies I have observed in my XXXX  transactions : Each time I purchased XXXX and transferred it, I believed I was sending the exact amount I had bought. However, it became apparent that a larger amount was being withdrawn. I suspect this issue began when I won XXXX XXXX  through XXXX. At that time, I was new to XXXX and unsure if I had understood the amount correctly. I later realized that the amount I believed I XXXX XXXXmight  have been altered to just XXXX XXXX. 

This issue persisted for many years without my knowledge, largely because I was unable to see these discrepancies unless I downloaded my transaction history. The recent transaction history displayed on the website did not reflect these issues. The evidence I will provide clearly shows that the amount of XXXX I intended to send or withdraw never matched what was actually deducted, with much larger amounts being withdrawn.

05/20/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Today, Bank of America ran an automatic payment to my BoA credit card from my checking account at XXXX XXXX  for {$19000.00}. This was an unauthorized auto debit that caused me to be overdrawn at my bank by {$13000.00}. And it resulted in a credit balance on my credit card at Bank of America of {$16000.00}, which should have immediately made Bank of America aware that no such auto debit was warranted. I called to advise them of their error, which they admitted was their own error, but they then refused to do anything to remedy the problem. They only offered to send me a check in 10 days, a direct deposit in three days, or allow me to apply for more credit so I could go make a deposit at XXXX XXXX a BoA service charge of {$670.00}. This is nothing short of stunning that they would ask me to apply for credit in order to receive repayment of the money effectively stolen from my bank account. I was transferred to over seven different offices at Bank of America and still received no remedy. The problems caused by taking {$19000.00} in an unauthorized manner from a consumers checking account are immeasurable. Please provide assistance. Thanking you in advance, XXXX. XXXX XXXX.

04/23/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Was referred to ALLY BANK by an online contact using their provided link which offered a {$100.00} bonus if the account was opened within a specified time frame and then a direct deposit was made to the account. I registered for the promotion and received a confirmation email from ALLY BANK that I was eligible to apply and receive the bonus. 

On XX/XX/year>, I applied for the account using the referral link with the bonus promotion attached and displayed on the screen. The account application was approved and opened automatically. I immediately initiated a {$100.00} transfer to fund the account which posted to the new account on XX/XX/year>. I also arranged for my next direct deposit to be sent to this account to fulfill the terms of the sign up bonus. A {$100.00} payroll deposit posted to the account on XX/XX/year>. The {$100.00} promotional bonus should have been credited to the new account by XX/XX/year> per the terms of their offer. 

By XX/XX/year> the bonus {$100.00} still had not been credited so I contacted ALLY BANK support staff to inquire into the matter. The agent I spoke with said that because there is an account at ALLY BANK owned by a trust for which I serve as Trustee, I am already in their system and thus the bonus was not automatically issued. We went over the terms of the bonus offer together. The terms of the bonus list "" Excluded Friends '' who are not eligible for the promotion as a person who has an account at ALLY. It does not exclude the trustee or beneficiary of a trust, and even if the trust is being treated as an "" artificial person '' as per the law, that artificial person is separate and distinct as a trust - not an individual. The terms of the bonus also specifically exclude trust owned accounts from being eligible for any of their promotions so ALLY BANK does consider them different from actual new customers as per their own terms. The agent agreed with me that the terms were met but had no authority to act on the matter so assured me they forwarded the matter to what they called "" back office review ''. I was then given a confirmation number ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) and told someone would manually initiate the promotional bonus from the back end and contact me within 7-10 business days. 

By XX/XX/year>, I still had not received the {$100.00} promotional credit and no one had made any effort to contact me by telephone nor mailed me any information. I spoke with another agent to check on the status and provided the confirmation number. They had no additional information about my investigation but assured me someone would contact me within XXXX business days. I was never contacted and the promotional credit is still not in my account. 

This morning, XX/XX/year>, I have attempted to reach out to ALLY BANK and was given the same speech as my call on the XXXX, leading me to believe there is no actual back office investigation and or the customer support agents are not following the proper steps to get this matter resolved.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,ALLY FINANCIAL INC.,MI,48021,,Consent provided,Web,04/23/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13110173.0

02/15/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"On XX/XX/2023, shortly after midnight, I received a text from someone claiming to be my sister in law. The person said that her daughter XXXX owed some people money and they wanted it now, but she didn't have a PayPal account to send the money, and could I send it. I said that I would help, since I had a PayPal account. She first asked for {$300.00}, to be sent to a person I didn't know, then she said that didn't go through, to send {$300.00} to someone else, and another {$500.00} to that person. When I said I didn't have that kind of money in my account, I was threatened with not being able to see my brother or be welcomed to their house. I was told to transfer the money with my debit card so they would get the money right away instead of waiting a few days for the transfer. Then they asked me to buy {$1000.00} in bit coin, and to send it to a different account, I purchased the bit coin and had to add an extra {$100.00} for fees. The bitcoin didn't transfer, fortunately. When I saw my sister in law in the afternoon of that day, she had no idea what I was talking about. I immediately called PayPal to file a fraud claim, and was told that since I made the transfers of my own accord, that it was personnel, and not a business transaction, there was no fraud, and to call my bank. I tried to contact the people I sent the money to, but their accounts were gone. I called my bank, and the fraud department took the information and said they would get back to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$1200.00} was transferred back into my account, in the amounts of {$100.00}, {$300.00}. {$300.00}, and {$500.00}. I thought everything was settled, but sadly it wasn't. PayPal said it was a charge back, and that I owed them the money. I don't know what a charge back was, and was told that they had paid the fraudulent accounts and paid the bank as well. I told them that I was told there was no fraud so why did you give the money to the bank. No reply. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a collection agency, and called them to say I don't owe this money, and explained what happened and why I felt I didn't owe PayPal. I was told to call PayPal and ask for records that the money was deposited into my account. Paypal Closed my account and I had no way of getting to see what had happened and to who the money went to. PayPal doesn't care that I was scammed. PayPal is a large company, and repaying someone who was scammed {$1200.00} certainly won't hurt their bottom line, and would show that they are a good company to do business with. In the meantime, I have set up monthly payments of {$25.00}. I will not do business with them again, and will be very cautious of people texting me and asking for money. Thank you.

09/19/24,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Re ; Wells Fargo Claim Claim # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX Wells Fargo Acct # XXXX ( XXXX  Acct ) I have been with Wells Fargo since XXXX Lost : {$17000.00} In XX/XX/XXXX early in the morning ( approx. XXXX XXXX  ) I was reviewing some transactions in my bank account via my desktop computer and was ready to call my bank, Wells Fargo, to question such transactions, even though I noticed that the bank had reversed the entries. 
While I was on my system and very coincidental, at XXXX XXXX  I received a call from XXXX claiming to be Wells Fargo and I was told the following : 1.- that my account had some questionable transactions 2.- that my branch in XXXX as well as the one in XXXX were under investigation and 3.- that they needed me to go to both branches, go to the teller inside the bank, withdraw funds from my account and then immediately deposit such funds back into my same account via the ATM outside the bank. 

I agreed to do this since because I was doing the withdrawing from and depositing into my own account and saw no risk in doing that. 

I then proceeded to go to the Wells Fargo Branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX, which is very close to my house. While this is going Wells Fargo ( supposedly ) was on the line with me ( cell ). Went to the teller inside the branch and at XXXX XXXX  EST, withdrew {$9800.00} as instructed, see receipt marked XXXX XXXX showing the date & time of the withdrawal. I then, following the instructions of Wells Fargo ( supposedly ), proceeded to the ATM which is next to the main entrance of this branch, to deposit the {$9800.00}. 

While at the ATM I used my Wells Fargo Card # XXXX XXXX XXXX to identify myself, see XXXX XXXX  and proceeded to request deposit at that time the receiving door opened and I placed the XXXX {$100.00} dollar bills I just withdrew, to be deposited. The ATM door closed, proceeded with the deposit, the door then opened again and returned 2 {$100.00} bills which were rejected and not deposited ( supposedly ). No receipt for the {$9600.00} deposit was issued by the ATM. During this transaction, the number XXXX _ or XXXX _ _ either appeared on the ATM screen or I was told to enter it as a transaction code by the supposedly Wells Fargo person on the phone with me. 

I then proceeded to the 2nd Wells Fargo Branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX and again, while this is going Wells Fargo ( supposedly ) was on the line with me. Went to the teller inside the branch and at XXXX XXXX  EST, withdrew {$7500.00} as instructed, see receipt marked XXXX XXXX, showing the date & time of the withdrawal. I then, following the instructions of Wells Fargo ( supposedly ) proceeded to the ATM which is next to the main entrance of this branch, to deposit the {$7500.00}. 
While at the ATM I again used my Wells Fargo Card # XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to identify myself and proceeded to request deposit at that time the receiving door opened and I placed the XXXX {$100.00} dollar bills just withdrew to be deposited. The ATM door closed, proceeded with the deposit, the door then opened again and returned XXXX {$100.00} bill which was rejected and not deposited ( supposedly ). No receipt for the {$7400.00} deposit was issued by the ATM. During this transaction, the number XXXX _ or XXXX _ _ again, either appeared on the ATM screen or I was told to enter it as a transaction code by the supposedly Wells Fargo person on the phone with me. 

I was not concerned about the receipt because I have deposited many times during my 40 years with Wells Fargo and this was not the first time I had no receipts for the deposit, usually after a deposit without a receipt, just went home, check my bank account via my computer, see the deposit and that was it. On this occasion, did the same thing and when I did not see the 2 deposits, I immediately returned to my branch which is the one where I withdrew & deposited the {$7500.00}. 

I immediately open a claim. Thereafter other claims were opened by me and apparently by the bank. At this time, some are closed, without any explanation and others are still open, following please find the claim numbers : Claim # XXXX Closed???? 
Claim # XXXX - Closed?? 
Claim # XXXX Closed????? 
Claim # XXXX Open I reported this issue to XXXX Police Dept . Report attached. see XXXX  XXXX. 

Received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX referencing claim # XXXX which as you can read, have no idea what they were saying since they are talking about checks deposited and this transaction was based on 2 CASH DEPOSITS not check deposited.

All ATMs transactions must have a record. Date, Time of the customer that accessed the ATM, type of transaction customer requested, either a deposit, a withdrawal or simply information. Whatever happened MUST AND IS RECORDED!!!!. 

The transactions on the ATM must be balanced every day. The next morning when the bank opens, the officers of the branch open the ATM, removes the cash and other instruments deposited the day before and the ATM is set up for the following day transaction. But again, the ATM must balance. 

In my case, I deposited XXXX {$100.00} dollar bills, the ATM returned 2 bills, meaning that XXXX {$100.00} dollar bills or {$9600.00} was deposited at the XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX between XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX and there has to be a record of a deposit of {$9600.00} in {$100.00} dollar bills going somewhere!!!!!!

Despite my prompt reporting of these fraudulent activities, Chase Bank has dismissed my claims on the basis that the transactions were "" authorized. '' This response is wholly inadequate and represents a failure to protect my consumer rights under federal law. 

Details of Fraudulent Transactions : XX/XX/XXXX : {$2500.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$5000.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$600.00} These transactions were executed via XXXX from my Chase business account. Despite my compliance with all necessary protocols to report these transactions as fraudulent, Chase Bank has neglected its duty to protect my assets and uphold my rights as a consumer. 

Violation of Federal Laws : The actions of XXXX and Chase Bank are in direct violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E, which mandate consumer protection against unauthorized and fraudulent electronic fund transfers. Specifically : EFTA Section 907 ( a ) : Prohibits unauthorized electronic fund transfers. 
Regulation E, Section 1005.11 : Requires financial institutions to investigate and resolve errors, including unauthorized transactions, within specified timeframes. 

The blatant disregard for these legal protections by both XXXX and Chase Bank necessitates immediate rectification and accountability. 

Demands for Resolution : Comprehensive Investigation : A thorough and immediate investigation into the fraudulent transactions and the practices of XXXX and Chase Bank that facilitated this fraud. 
Reversal of Fraudulent Transactions : Immediate restitution of the {$8100.00} lost due to these fraudulent transactions. 

Enhanced Security Measures : Implementation of robust security protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

Legal Accountability : Pursuit of punitive measures against XXXX and Chase Bank for their failure to adhere to federal laws protecting consumers against fraud. 

Supporting Documentation : Enclosed are screenshots of communications and other relevant documentation evidencing the fraudulent nature of these transactions. 

Conclusion : The negligence demonstrated by XXXX and Chase Bank in handling this matter is egregious and warrants immediate and decisive action. I expect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to uphold their mandate to protect consumers by taking swift and effective action to address this issue. Additionally, I ask for provisional credit to be considered during the investigation period, as outlined under Regulation E, to ensure that I can meet my ongoing financial commitments.

So I called the credit card company and asked about the Cash Advance Fees and was told it was for buying lottery tickets, that is a new charge with their company. I was not aware of this change and never received any literature or warning of it. I was also told that it accrues interest DAILY until it's paid for! If I didn't notice this, it would keep growing until my statement came in the mail at the end of the month! I called the lottery commission and they have no knowledge of charges like this. You can't get cash back from a lottery credit card processor. The store that sells the lottery has nothing to do with it. It is the CREDIT CARD COMPANY that has decided to charge lottery tickets and any form of casino gambling as cash advances. Due to the other unauthorized charge, I had both cards reissued with new numbers. These charges are outrageous and the consumer doesn't know about it until it happens! I wanted them to reimburse me for the cash advance fee and they said they would have to cancel the charge associated with it, which doesn't make sense, because you really can't return lottery tickets!

In my capacity as a natural person, the inclusion of my social security number on the credit application serves to facilitate this XXXX XXXX for securitization objectives. This process aims to establish an unbound credit limit based on my XXXX 

This notice stands as a declaration of breach of fiduciary duty and my right of subrogation. I insist on the proper allocation of credits and rights associated with my application. Failure to return the assets or acknowledge their intended use within XXXX business days will compel me to take regulatory actions. These may include filing complaints with the SEC and IRS regarding potential abusive tax schemes linked to the SEC-filed trust arrangement. 

As a globally integrated payments company, BANK OF AMERICA provides a diverse array of products and services, including credit and charge cards, as well as travel and lifestyle offerings. It operates under rigorous regulatory supervision by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. 
This notice aims for a fair resolution to the outlined issues, in line with the principle that equity prevents injustices without recourse. It emphasizes that those seeking equity must act fairly, impacting all involved parties personally. The terms laid out here necessitate equitable treatment, asserting that the essence of my application justifies an unlimited credit limit. 

Upon submitting my application to Bank of America, I was denied access to my personal credit, purportedly due to private non-public information unlawfully obtained by you from credit reporting agencies. My application represents a written request for a credit extension, made in accordance with the procedures outlined in XXXX CFR Subchapter A part XXXX. According to your prospectus report, my application, upon submission, is purchased at a discounted rate and converted into a receivable/treasury marketable security, i.e., a trust asset as per section XXXX. 
I seek clarification on the reasons behind this denial of credit. According to Section XXXX ( XXXX ) of the Federal Reserve Act, "" In no event shall such collateral security be less than the amount of Federal Reserve notes applied for. Therefore, as a consumer, I should not have been denied credit. Furthermore, under the FCRA, it appears that socioeconomic discrimination has been employed against me. The information utilized by Bank of America to assess my 'creditworthiness ' constitutes personal non-public information acquired from a third-party company. This adverse action has caused me injury and emotional distress, as I have been unable to obtain necessities for my personal development and growth. I am deeply troubled by these actions. 
The XXXX Report XXXX Bank of America outlines that the primary assets of the trust include receivables from designated XXXX Bank of America credit card accounts and Pay Over Time revolving credit features. These receivables comprise both principal and finance charge receivables. 
I question whether I was discriminated against and denied open-ended credits based on my XXXX XXXXXXXX, given that I provided Bank of America XXXX XXXX tender, i.e., my duly tendered, endorsed, and signed application. Does Bank of America 's policy grant it the authority to disregard the encoded rules of XXXX USC XXXX, which asserts my right to the enjoyment and benefit of my contract? 

Does Bank of America 's policy grant it the authority to omit crucial information while utilizing complex legal and technical business terminology? Extrinsic XXXX  refers to deceptive acts or misrepresentations made outside the main event, which deprive the victim of vital information or involvement. Moreover, my original promissory note, initially intended as an application, was converted into a receivable/trust asset by Bank of America without my knowledge or consent. This critical detail has never been disclosed to me by Bank of America. 

If, by any chance, I have granted Bank of America authorization and/or Power of Attorney privileges, whether explicitly or implicitly, I hereby revoke all such authority and rescind Bank of America XXXX XXXX interest. According to the XXXX Report XXXX Bank of America, it states that "" The certificates will evidence undivided beneficial interests in the trust assets allocated to such certificates, representing the right to receive from such trust assets funds up to ( but not in excess of ) the amounts required to make payments of interest and principal in the manner described below. The certificates will be available for purchase in minimum denominations of { {$100000.00} } and integral multiples of { {$1000.00} } in book-entry form Payments of interest and principal will be made on each related interest payment date to the certificate holders in whose names the certificates were registered on the last day of the calendar month preceding such interest payment date, known as the record date. 
Consequently, if the application/securities/receivables are registered in my name, then all interest and dividends are rightfully due to me, the consumer. Does Bank of America 's policy grant it the right to exploit and deprive consumers? The actions of Bank of America against me are inherently actionable. If your response to this complaint is conveyed by an attorney or any member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I hope they seriously consider their oath, which states, I solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States, that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of attorney, and that I will conduct myself at all times with integrity and civility. Any action contrary to this oath constitutes misconduct and is inherently actionable.

A staff member of the bank introduced to me the basic details of a financial product in XXXX, highlighting that the investment XXXX is XXXX year, with a guaranteed return of the principal upon maturity. They took advantage of my limited XXXX proficiency to urge me into signing the contract for their financial product. However, I have today discovered that the actual terms of the financial product bear no resemblance to what was initially presented. Their deceptive conduct led me to make an ill - informed investment decision, resulting in significant financial losses. 
This incident has not only imposed a substantial financial burden and immense psychological stress on XXXX clients like me who have been victimized but also severely undermined the confidence of international clients in the US financial sector. Many international users in my circle, upon learning of this matter, have expressed profound doubts regarding the regulatory rigor and effectiveness of the US financial market.

I kindly request your assistance in enforcing my legal rights and addressing these matters with the respective creditors. 

The violations I am raising concern about have had a profound impact on my life, affecting my financial well-being and emotional state. These violations have caused undue stress, XXXX, and uncertainty, as my credit report contains inaccuracies and questionable information that tarnish my creditworthiness and personal integrity. 

Unauthorized Inquiries and Inaccurate Account Reporting : Several creditors, namely XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and others, have made unauthorized inquiries into my credit report without my consent. These inquiries were conducted on various dates, as specified in my previous correspondence. These unauthorized inquiries have left me feeling powerless and violated, as my personal information was accessed without my knowledge or permission. 

Furthermore, there are instances where my account information has been inaccurately reported, leading to incorrect representations of my credit history. For example, the accounts associated with XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX( Account Number : XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ), XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ), and others have been inaccurately reported, impacting my credit score and potential lending opportunities. These inaccuracies have caused unjust hardships and hindered my ability to secure favorable financial terms when needed. 

Personal Impact : I want to emphasize the personal toll these violations have taken on my life. The stress and emotional distress resulting from the inaccuracies and unauthorized inquiries have disrupted my peace of mind. As I strive to manage my finances responsibly, I find myself facing obstacles that were not of my making. This situation has affected not only my ability to secure loans and credit but has also caused significant XXXX  and sleepless nights. 

Request for Action : I implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to enforce my legal rights and ensure that these violations are addressed promptly. I kindly request that you work with the respective creditors to investigate and rectify the unauthorized inquiries and inaccuracies on my credit report, specifically related to the accounts listed below : XX/XX/XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) I believe that the removal of these unverified accounts from my credit report is essential to restoring my financial well-being and mental peace. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and your commitment to protecting consumers ' rights. Please keep me informed of the progress made in addressing these violations and seeking resolution with the creditors. I look forward to a favorable outcome that will help alleviate the burdens caused by these unjust circumstances. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

In XXXX, I set up autopay from my XXXX account ( ending XXXX ) for my BofA credit card. It worked without issue for four years until XXXX, XXXX. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I found a late payment for {$15.00} ( statement XXXX, due date XX/XX/XXXX ) over 30 days past due, reported to the 3 credit bureaus, which causes them mark this card past due in XX/XX/XXXX. BofA didn't send any email to notify the past due bill. 

XXXX. I discovered that autopay settings were deleted. I called BofA ( XXXX ), rep advised manual payment and autopay reset and then contact them again. I did manual payment and autopay reset as they suggested. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA again to figure out whats wrong. BofA confirmed the issue was their bank systems fault by the phone, not mine. They said sometimes the bank system will lose autopay setting. Case ID : XXXX XXXX csa XXXX XXXX was created, and they promised to revert the negative report. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA to track the progress of the case. Them claimed the case was resolved and advised waiting for updates of the new credit reports. I concerned but complied. 

XXXX. After several days, I disputed with the credit bureaus, providing the BofA case ID, to ask them help track the revert progress. All disputes failed as BofA did not authorize the removal per feedback from the 3 credit bureaus. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the latest credit reports came out, but still showed the late payment. BofA took no action despite their promise. Then I filed a complaint to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, the complaint ID is XXXX.

What happened : On XX/XX/year>, I was wrongly charged {$400.00} by a hotel for a smoking fee. I did not smoke in the room. The charge was based solely on an automated smoke report that triggered around XXXXXXXX XXXX. and continued past XXXXXXXX XXXX., while I was asleep. I had showered and gone to bed earlier. No hotel staff ever entered the room or verified the alert. 

When I asked the front desk manager ( the only person Ive been allowed to speak to ), why no one came to the room, he said they do not have to physically verify it and only rely on the smoke report. Thats unreasonable, especially since smoke sensors can be triggered by non-smoking causes like steam or aerosol. 

I disputed the charge with Barclays, and they mishandled the process from the start : They misfiled the dispute as an altered amount instead of an unauthorized transaction. 

They denied it in a letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, but I was out of town for work and did not receive the letter until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called immediately and was told the dispute would be reopened correctly. 

In XXXX, I found out it was never reopened. I called again and asked for a manager. 

A manager called once, on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, left a hard-to-hear voicemail with no direct callback number. 

When I called back, I had to start over. I was eventually told to send a written letter and assured it was not too late. 

I sent the letter via certified mail. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) again denying the dispute and now claiming its too late, despite all previous reassurances and delays being Barclays fault. 

This latest letter also again listed the charge incorrectly as {$390.00} instead of the correct {$400.00}, despite my previous corrections. 


The hotel has refused to let me speak to anyone other than the front desk manager, who told me flatly : > It goes no further than me. Whats done is done. 
Ive left multiple voicemails for the general and assistant managers none have responded. 

Now Barclays is threatening to report this charge to the credit bureaus if I dont pay it even though it remains disputed and theyre the ones who mishandled the process repeatedly over XXXX months. 


I have been traveling for 26 years for business and have stayed in thousands of hotel rooms during that time.

Since I do not understand XXXX, I followed the icons displayed on the ATM screen to complete the transaction. After inserting my bank card and entering my PIN, I tried to deposit cash. However, due to my inability to understand the English instructions, I pressed the Check button. A slot opened below the ATM, and I placed XXXX {$100.00} bills ( totaling {$500.00} ) into the slot. The slot closed immediately after. 

Shortly afterward, the ATM prompted me to retrieve my bank card. At that moment, I realized I might have made an error, but the cash was already inside the ATM. I repeatedly inserted my card, hoping to reopen the slot, but the cash could not be located. 

I took photos of the ATM, including its ID number ( ID # XXXX ), and contacted my family for assistance. My family helped me call Citibank and report the issue. Over the phone, the bank staff, assisted by a translator, assured me they understood the situation and asked me to wait for their investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I personally visited the bank to follow up and provided the details again. The staff submitted an investigation request on their computer. Since then, I have been waiting for updates from the bank, but no substantial progress has been made. 

During this period, Citibank sent three letters : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Thank you for contacting us regarding the above-referenced checking account on XX/XX/year>. Please rest assured that we are reviewing your inquiry and will contact you in writing with the results of our investigation. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Thank you for contacting us regarding the deposit of {$500.00} made at the ATM on XX/XX/year>. We have completed our review. Our records indicate that there were no cash discrepancies at the relevant time and location. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Thank you for contacting us regarding the above-referenced checking account on XX/XX/year>. Please rest assured that we are reviewing your inquiry and will contact you in writing with the results of our investigation. 

I received each of these letters XXXX days after the mailing dates. 

This is the full account of what happened. During this time, I have visited the bank several times, but there has been no resolution or clarification of where the {$500.00} cash I deposited went. 

I am now seeking a clear explanation. Where is the {$500.00} cash that I deposited into the ATM? 
Did the ATM malfunction and consume the cash? 
Did a bank employee intercept the cash during processing and fail to report it? 
Or does Citibank assume that a customer like me, who doesnt understand English, can be easily deceived and has decided not to return my money? 

In this era of advanced technology and information systems, banks have access to sophisticated monitoring systems. Can this issue truly not be investigated and clarified? 

I demand a definitive answer. How can cash deposited into an ATM simply disappear?

03/16/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute, Demand for Return of Security/Investment & Inquiry Regarding Securitization of Personal Information To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to address and formally dispute the adverse action taken against me regarding the recent denial of my credit application with American Express. I find it particularly troubling, given that American Express has continuously and aggressively solicited my business through targeted marketing and promotions. This solicitation creates an expectation of fair dealing, yet after collecting my highly sensitive personal data including my Social Security number American Express not only denied me but also appears to have used my information for its own financial gain. 

Based on publicly available information, including details from American Express most recent prospectus, it is clear that the company securitizes applications, contracts, and account receivables as part of its strategy to create financial instruments. These instruments are then transferred to third parties or bundled into asset-backed securities, which are subsequently used to raise capital and expand business operations. This process effectively transforms customer applications and agreements into marketable securities, subject to financial trading and liquidity generation. 

By collecting my personal information and application data, American Express has received and converted this into an instrument that has tangible value within financial markets. Whether directly or indirectly, my data may have been incorporated into pools of assets that American Express securitizes and uses as leverage for funding activities, increasing shareholder value, or meeting regulatory capital requirements.

Given this reality, it is clear that my application which you have chosen to deny has nevertheless provided American Express with a form of security or investment through its contribution to the companys securitization and funding mechanisms. Denying me the credit facility while retaining the value generated from my data raises ethical and potentially legal concerns. 

Demand for Remedy : Given that my application and personal information may have been utilized in securitization processes that benefit American Expresss capital and business expansion strategies, I find the denial of my credit application unjust. Therefore, I formally request the following remedy : 1. Approval of a Lifetime Credit Facility : Immediate approval of an American Express credit card with an unlimited credit line for the duration of my lifetime.

2. Proper Discharge of Account : Assurance that this account will be managed in accordance with the discharge, cancellation, and satisfaction provisions outlined in your indenture agreements, specifically those pertaining to noteholders. 

[ Securitization and Use of Personal Information ] : Publicly available documents, such as the American Express Issuance Trust II indenture, indicate that American Express engages in the securitization of receivables and related assets. Specifically, Section 6.01 of the indenture discusses the Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture, stating : This Indenture will cease to be of further effect with respect to any Series, Class or Tranche of Notes when : ( a ) all Notes of that Series, Class or Tranche theretofore authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the Indenture Trustee canceled or for cancellation ; ( b ) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder ; and ( c ) the Issuer has delivered to the Indenture Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Notes of that Series, Class or Tranche have been complied with. 

This suggests that American Express has mechanisms to discharge obligations related to securitized instruments upon fulfillment of specific conditions. 


Additional Demands : Furthermore, I reiterate my previous demands : 1. A comprehensive explanation for the adverse action taken against me.

2. A detailed account of how my personal information, including my Social Security number, has been utilized, particularly concerning securitization activities and transfers to third parties.

3. Disclosure of any financial instruments created using my data and how such instruments have been leveraged to raise capital.

4. If American Express chooses not to extend the requested credit facility, I demand the return of any value or investment derived from my personal information and application. 

Failure to address this matter satisfactorily within 30 days will compel me to escalate my complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory bodies. I am prepared to pursue all necessary actions to protect my rights and recover any value unjustly retained by American Express. 

I expect a prompt and equitable resolution.

07-02-2024,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"XXXX Case # XXXX I was involved in a fraud occurrence on XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX That evening I called the XXXX XXXX , for assistance in getting my XXXX feed working, the agent remoted into my phone ( using XXXXXXXX XXXX app ) to fix the problem with system access. She then entered my phone system and removed money from several accounts. I saw neither a request for a 6-character authentication code or for a 4-character pin #, I did see a XXXX  transaction flash on my phone then I realized there was a problem. I hung up checked my accounts and immediately called XXXX and the accounts I could see were involved. Some of the calls and visits had to be completed on the following Monday due to the weekend. 
Cash App was one of the companies defrauded ( see attached ). When I called them, the CashApp agent posted a list of information that I had to supply. I was on the phone and the list was so long it filled more than a screen before I started completing it. It would have taken at least 15 20 minutes to complete. It would have been good if I could have cut and pasted the information into the form or if Cash App had emailed the list, but that was not an option. The agent was not willing to wait and took a verbal report and said he would investigate and contact me in a few days. 
On XX/XX/year> I saw the fraudulent transactions on my account and called CashApp, to verify that they saw them and told them the number I dialed for XXXX XXXX. They said they were reviewing the case and had all the information they needed. I would receive a response when the investigation was complete. 
On XX/XX/year> I received notice that my claim had been denied ( see attached ). They said that I authorized the transaction ( s ) there were 2. The 1st withdrew {$400.00} from my Cash App account to purchase XXXX  ; the 2nd used the XXXX  to purchase lawn service ( a copy of the transactions is attached ). Why would I buy XXXX  to pay for lawncare would have been easier, faster, and more accurate to pay cash for the service. I did not make or authorize the transactions. Didnt know they were being made called Cash App immediately when I saw the transaction. Will Conversations with Cash App following denial of claim. 
1st call dropped before account information was completed Whats your problem, whats your phone #? Then, - Click ( hang up ). 
2nd call to XXXX ( Responses to my concerns from Cash App are below ) Case is closed can not be reopened investigation ended. They will send email about their investigation that I can forward to police the XXXX XXXX police only make a report to agencies and they dont follow-up on information from Vendors. Cash App doesnt want police report number or information they dont contact the authorities but the authorities can contact them. 
I asked Cash App for assistance with the XXXX  processes, they stated that they did not get involved with XXXX  transactions no assistance. My final request, Cash App CSAs can not lower the {$15000.00} credit limit on my account dont know process or whom to contact. 
This is case # XXXX I can open a new claim. 
3rd call On XX/XX/year>, I received Cash Apps proof that the fraud was authorized ( see attached ). They sent the 2nd part of the transaction ( see attached ) where the stolen {$400.00} was used to purchase lawn service. For the last 3 years, I pay {$65.00} every 2 weeks for lawn service ; except one week when I purchase pine straw and thats around {$300.00} in Georgia, where my home and lawn service is. 
CashApp will not open a new claim, because you cant give us any information that we do not have already ( per the CSA ). The {$400.00} taken from me at Cash App was from my personal account on their site no loss to them or the insurance. They stated that the transactions were authorized by me. Even though I have never made a XXXX  purchase. I also believe there are tax ramifications for the XXXX  transactions, I will have to pay an accountant to handle the transactions which are not mine. If the Cash App CSAs have reviewed my accounts they would have seen that I had never made a XXXX  purchase, that I do have a lawn service in Georgia ( have the same company for 3 years ) and I have never paid {$400.00} for lawncare ( usually {$65.00} every 2 weeks ). The person who made the charges obviously had a XXXX account ( or created one ) with Cash App. She pulled {$400.00} from my account and purchased the XXXX then transferred it to the lawn service account. This was fraud that Cash App allowed to take place on their site. Did they do anything to stop it or to find the source of the theft? They may have even been able to retrieve my {$400.00} if not, they let me and other persons be swindled. Did Cash App report any of the information I gave them to the authorities? I do know that 2 weeks later the person was still using the XXXX XXXX ID to swindle customers. per XXXX. I called XXXX and reported it again I would like Cash App to return the {$400.00} that they authorized through fraudulent transactions. The authorities have verified that it is fraud and the other thefts have been resolved. Does Cash App know anything about the company XXXX XXXXXXXX ( the company for whom they opened an account and sent money )? Did Cash App try to find information on the company or are the thieves continuing to use the account for fraudulent transactions? Does $ XXXX have information about the lawn service I received in XXXX, GA? I also want the {$15000.00} credit limit on my Cash App account lowered to {$1000.00} and I do not want any permanent connections between Cash App and my bank account or other financial accounts. Unfortunately, I have vendors who only use Cash App for transactions, so I can not permanently drop them. 
Please assist me in getting my account refunded from Cash App. I understand that fraud is rampant and maybe difficult to control. My findings on the subject is thee are few to companies that attempt to stop fraud. Their main goal is to not reimburse customers for losses. If they took some time, gathered and reviewed information from their customers they may be able to stop some of the thefts. They even make it hard to file a report on your incident sending a list to a phone page that cant be easily updated is nuts. The goal is to handle the issue fast and send the customer a canned denial with safety suggestions that you already are following or dont refer to the particular incident. Why not ban apps like XXXX or have better control over them? The customers need help. 
I have used Cash App for over 3 years and online banking for over 30 years. This is the 1st time I have seen frauudulent activity on any of my accounts.

All my accounts were current and in good standing, and I have not received any valid explanation for this suspension. 
I want to emphasize that withholding my access to my securities constitutes security fraud. As a consumer, I have the right to credit, and this action is a violation of the Consumer Credit Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Regardless of the reason for revoking my credit line, this decision has had a significantly negative impact on my credit score. 
I kindly request an immediate investigation into this matter and urge you to retract this decision promptly. I expect a thorough explanation for this action, and I anticipate a resolution to this issue without further delay. 
Sincerely, Consumer Credit Act : The Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ) is a federal law that encompasses several statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). These laws protect consumers in various ways, such as ensuring accurate credit reporting, promoting fair lending practices, and regulating debt collection activities. 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act : The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) is a part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. It prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age ( provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract ), or because the applicant receives income from any public assistance program. 
I went through a lengthy process of verifying my income providing bank statements etc. which was ultimately denied because I wrote the starting balance incorrectly, instead of clarifying this information my account was closed without notice and refusal to reopen. 
I have called in an attempt to resolve this matter and was denied by a XXXX or XXXX who submitted a complaint on my behalf as Manager was not taking phones calls. 
Violations of these laws can result in civil penalties and fines imposed by regulatory agencies, and individuals who believe their rights under these laws have been violated can file complaints or lawsuits seeking damages. It's important to consult legal counsel or the appropriate regulatory authority for specific and up-to-date information regarding these laws.

I have already been scammed out of {$91.00} for cheap, stained and used garments, DISCOVER is asking me to spend more money to send the package to an unknown, very long and suspicious address in XXXX with the hope I will be refunded. I have absolutely no faith in the scammer who does business in US by 2 names ( XXXX  ) and ( XXXX  ) and operates from 3 different addresses that they will refund me XXXX XXXX out of my {$91.00}. 
The address they asked me to return the garments is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is obvious to the naked eye that this is a fake, made up address and I will not risk paying expensive postage to mail the counterfeit garments, UNLESS Discover guarantees me that if the SCAMMER does not refund me my money, the credit card will.

To make matters even more stressful for me, DISCOVER banned me from communicating with them by phone because "" I was not respectful in my phone communications to their reps '', and forcing me again to communicate via fax ( which I do not have ) and mail at my cost. 
I wrote a letter to DISCOVER 's Executive office of Customer Advocacy explaining how I feel I have been mistreated by their reps in being shoved from extension to extension and made to repeat again, and again the reason of my calls and what I was trying to accomplish and never once they admitted that the DISCOVER website for uploading documentation in support of a billing dispute is OBSOLETE due to outdated technology and DISCOVER 's unwillingness to update it and make its customers ' lives easier.

I've been a DISCOVER customer for over 20 years and always, paid my monthly balance in full. I will never forget the ingratitude, cheap corporate games and lack of customer support of this credit card and I will not cease to fight until I receive the justice due to me.",,DISCOVER BANK,PA,19083,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09-09-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10051702.0

After the bank processed the deposit, they placed a hold on the funds until XX/XX/year>. This hold period is standard practice for certain types of checks or deposit amounts, but in this case, it has resulted in a significant delay in accessing my funds. 

When I inquired about the possibility of having the funds made available sooner, I explained that typically, banks are expected to make deposited funds available within 2-5 business days per federal law. However, the bank staff dismissed my request and stated that there is nothing they can do to expedite the release of my funds before the hold period ends on XX/XX/year>. 

This situation is deeply frustrating and distressing for several reasons : Financial Strain : I rely on my paycheck to cover essential expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, and other bills. The 11-day delay means I am unable to access my money when I need it most, leading to financial hardship and stress. 

Lack of Flexibility or Support : Despite my reasonable request for an earlier release, the bank 's refusal and their assertion that nothing can be done is disheartening. It feels like there is no consideration for the urgency of my situation. 

Impact on Daily Life : The delay has disrupted my financial planning and caused unnecessary hardship, which could have been mitigated if the funds were made available sooner. In addition to this hindering me from being able to obtain critical medicines. 

Overall, the delay and the bank 's response have caused significant frustration, anxiety, and financial difficulty.

BECU blocked my online account, but I had not been informed, so I just thought it was a technical error or a password problem. I tried several times over the following days and weeks, but could not access, so I decided to call and ask for help. When I called, BECU informed me that they had closed my accounts ( including my credit card, which I had made timely payments on ) because of the overdraft. They said it was turned over to their "" Financial Crimes '' department, which shocked me. I have never been treated like this by a bank. I have been a good customer and never had an issue. For them to respond in this manner was unfair, harsh, and lacked any kind of thoughtfulness toward me as a customer. 
When I looked into it, I found that I had deposited checks from another business of mine and from another personal account I held. The business has a couple of clients that owe a considerable amount of money ( over {$95000.00} ) and had been told one of the clients had wired the money to the accounts the checks were written from. They, in fact, had not, and were just trying to buy time to make their payment. I have been hit hard by the lack of payments from these clients, which know they owe the money. I'm sure they will pay, but I am having to reach out to them every few days to push them or at least get a status update. I've been assured that I will be paid, but I need BECU to be patient and understanding, while I work on getting this resolved with my clients, so I can cure the debt owed to BECU. 
I feel terrible about the overdrafts, and I will take care of what I owe. This was uninntentional on my end and, I believe, understandable. Some leeway should be granted to me by BECU, and allow me to make payments or wait until I am paid completely and can pay the entire amount owed ( approximately {$9000.00} total between the accounts ). I also need my access to the online banking restored, so I can make regular payments, get records of the transactions, get statements, and manage the accounts. Cutting me off immediately, put me in the dark, with no explanation for weeks. Had I known early on, I would have been able to track and manage this a lot better.

I signed up for this program XX/XX/XXXX and after about a month in the program I realized the program was all fluff and didn't deliver what it advertised. I asked for a refund from the company XXXX XXXX art or schulmanart.com. They gave me a standard sorry there's only a seven-day money back guarantee response. 
On XX/XX/2024, I then disputed the charge with my credit card which was Apple card XXXX Goldman Sachs. I did receive an initial credit while the dispute was being investigated by the Goldman Sachs XXXX department. On XX/XX/XXXX Goldman Sachs asked me to provide additional information to support my claim for the dispute. I provided this on the deadline they suggested of XX/XX/XXXX. Then on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail saying my dispute was not valid and I would be recharged for the {$1900.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I then called Apple card and got as many higher ups as I could on the phone least XXXX to XXXX different people and asked for a manager in the dispute department to be able to help me escalate my dispute. I was informed by a manager in the dispute department with Apple that I can not be transferred to the investigation department nor did they have a number I could call so basically I hit a dead end. The manager and the dispute department told me the only thing she could do was to make a note to escalate my complaint. However, my experience with the investigative department is that they don't respond to any emails, and they don't want to talk to you in person. 
After doing some research I found that I can complain to you regarding Goldman Sachs refusal to talk to me in person and having no way to contact them to have a personal discussion around this charge. 
Yesterday I immediately went back to XXXX art to ask them for a refund and have not received a response. The only action they have taken is to block me from their social media sites so that I can not leave a review. 
Hence This is why I'm escalating this complaint to CFPB. Below please see a summary of my reasons for my dispute with XXXX art. I presented all of these details plus a pile of other documents to the Goldman Sachs investigative department, and they still declined to uphold my dispute. 
I really do feel that Goldman Sachs is in the wrong here I feel like I have a very strong case proving my point that the {$1900.00} Let 's see I spent with XXXX art for a fluff art program claiming to be something that it is not, is a valid claim and that my dispute should be upheld and I should be reimbursed the money. 
Reasons for dispute With XXXX art : 1. The money back guarantee was for 7 days and this is a multi-week/month course and certain sections of the course are suggested for each week over an XXXX week period ( minimum! ). 
2. I did not sign any contract or agreement.

3. When I asked the merchant for a refund, the proprietor, XXXX XXXX, did not respond. She had a team member give a standard response. This is awful customer service. 
4. The Incubator course is sold as giving you secrets for selling your art. It is advertised for an XXXX at any level in their career. This is not true. The course is for beginners. Most of the material she teaches can be accessed for free on XXXX. 
5. Most of the video in the course is regurgitated prerecorded videos with XXXX minutes on the subject then a Q/A. Many of these are months/years old. 
6. The initial marketing video touted learn about art licensing, free templates for launching, marketing companies to submit to and a website review if you paid the full {$1900.00} up front. These were the main areas I wanted to do a deep dive in, and assumed the course had the goods. I thought it would be worth the money if indeed these were as she advertised. However : a. There are no templates for launching. She provided what she created for her own launches and graphic with those launches. I understood the templates would be fill in with your own copy. There are none of those. You have to create the entire launch series from scratch, since artists are not going to use the same graphic style and fonts that she used.

b. There was an example in the selling video of one of the Incubator artists that got into a major art magazine and sold about $ XXXX worth of work, yet nothing in the modules about which magazine that was or how to get into/which magazines to look into. The marketing companies is just a spreadsheet list of about XXXX podcasters, some of the contact links outdates. There is nothing about marking your work in publications, etc. which was touted as a selling point. Dont necessarily use social media, use publications and other forms of marketing! However, there is nothing in any of the modules about marketing in publications. There are publicity tips but no company/magazine suggestions. 
c. I still have not received a website review and I signed up at the end of XXXX! 
d. There is very little on art licensing and nothing in depth! The couple of interviews with art licensers did not have ANY in depth how tos they were both just general discussions for XXXX minutes with Q/As. I was so shocked that there was really nothing on licensing that I spent another {$500.00} with another company who had an entire course on licensing. 
XXXX. Her basic instruction, which is most of the course talks about things like : a. How to file b. General life coaching questions XXXX What to post on social media dXXXX XXXX XXXX instruction about XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX etc e. A Who Am I mastermind XXXX Possibility workshop XXXX how to create mixed media art nothing to do with selling our art XXXX. She includes Art Fairs and a packing checklist! I didnt sign up for that! I already know what Im doing in that area. Its like she threw a bunch of old documents that shes created over the years in her program to make it look deep but it is shallow! 
XXXX. Whats really telling is that she has written a book called XXXX which I have a copy of and have read the entire book ( after I signed up for the course ), and XXXX  %, including lists, suggestions, templates etc of what she teaches in her {$1900.00} course are in that book!

XXXX  Many creditors try to assert additional pressure on their debtors by issuing, or threatening to issue, a form required by the IRS ( form 1099-C ) informing the IRS that the full amount of the outstanding debt is cancelled even though the creditor intends to continue collection activities. IRS regulations require creditors to issue the 1099-C form if they cancel a debt of {$600.00} or more in any calendar year. Domestic banks, trust companies, credit unions, savings and loan associations, and any organization whose significant trade or business is the lending of money are subject to this regulation. Additional regulations ( 26 C.F.R. Section 1.6050 P-1 ) list several identifiable events that trigger the reporting obligation to file Form 1099-C. These events include discharge of debt in bankruptcy, expiration of the statute of limitations for collections, discharge by agreement of the parties, a creditors decision to discontinue collection activity and discharge the debt, and expiration of the non-payment testing period. Nothing in the statutes or regulations prohibits collection following the filing of a form 1099-C.

The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) treats cancelled debt as income to the debtor, which might subject the debtor to federal income tax. Many creditors try to assert additional pressure on debtors by issuing, or threatening to issue, Form 1099-C. However, a recent opinion ( In re XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) from Chief Judge XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Iowa reveals the peril a creditor XXXX face in issuing the debt cancellation notice. In fact, given this recent decision, debtors in the XXXX XXXX XXXX Iowa might welcome the receipt of form 1099-C. 

In XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX gave up trying to collect a debt from the XXXX that was secured by a mortgage on the XXXX house and issued Form 1099-C. The XXXX  reported the income and paid taxes on the cancelled debt. They subsequently filed a XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy petition. The XXXX XXXX  opposed the XXXX XXXX XXXX plan because it did not propose any payments to the XXXX  XXXX  on the original mortgage debt. The XXXX claimed that the credit union had discharged the debt by virtue of the 1099-C. Ruling in favor of the debtors, XXXX XXXX noted that the issuance/filing of form 1099-C by itself normally will not discharge the creditors underlying claim. Here, however, the notice, when coupled with the evidence that the debtors reported the income on their tax returns and paid the taxes due on that debt forgiveness, caused the debt to be canceled. The debtors were able to confirm their XXXX  XXXX plan based on the bankruptcy courts finding that the credit unions {$60000.00} of unpaid indebtedness was cancelled and that under XXXX  law a mortgage ceases to be enforceable when the debt underlying the lien no longer exists. Thus, the bankruptcy court removed both the credit unions mortgage lien and debt from the XXXX house. 

Although XXXX adopted the minority reasoning in these cases, it does strike at the majority rationale, which states that the filing of IRS Form 1099-C alone is not sufficient evidence that the debt has been cancelled. ( See F.D.I.C. v. Cashion, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). ) Under XXXX, the filing of Form 1099-C combined with the reporting of the forgiven income and payment of associated taxes is sufficient to cause a legal cancellation of the debtors loan and accompanying mortgage lien, at least under Iowa law .

Therefore, creditors must beware. Under the correct circumstances over which the creditor may have no control the issuing of Form 1099-C may effect a legal cancellation of the debt and release the liens securing the debt. Debtors should welcome Form 1099-C, report it on their next tax return, and pay the taxes due. Although no statutes or regulations prohibit collections on a debt after the filing of a Form 1099-C, creditors should be aware of the associated perils given the XXXX holding XXXX

I kindly request your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that I receive a fair and timely resolution. I believe Revolut should be held accountable for their failure to address my legitimate concerns and honor my consumer rights.

I was a victim of this performed by a national crime ring. I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that is on the stolen checks that were deposited into my account. The company representative said they get roughly 30 calls per day on this scam. She said one lady was scammed out of {$30000.00}. 
These people are obviously professionals. My part was applying for a loan online and followed instructions to get what I needed. I played no part in the fraud on purpose. If you look at those check deposits you will see the signatures are not mine. They were stolen, pictures taken, deposited online and Chase honored them. I did nothing wrong to warrant being held responsible for this fraud. I paid out 2 bills in the morning before you restricted the XXXX account. I did try to stop the XXXX payment of {$120.00}, but she refunded it instead of canceling it. That should be coming back into my account and I need that back to pay my phone bill as I am unemployed and have been for 9 months! Also coming in to that account on XX/XX/23, is my Social Security check that covers my rent and car payment. Please allow the XXXX account to remain open to receive that check and I will come in a get it that morning, and then you can close that account. I called SSA yesterday, but she said they need at least 2 weeks notice for the system to make a change in a direct deposit completion. If you close that account it will be kicked back, and my rent and car payment will be seriously delinquent. I can not afford that. Please work with me on this.

Despite multiple emails to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, they admitted that no work has even begun on restoring it and refused to provide a timeline. Their excuses make no sensethis is a basic financial feature that any competent engineering team could reinstate within a day. 

WaFds failure to restore the running balance and their shifting explanations suggest either negligence or an intentional decision to limit customer access to financial data.

Please see below for a detailed account of everything that happened and will need to be thoroughly reviewed. I have been calling daily and still haven't heard back. 

On XXXX XXXX while leaving the XXXX XXXX my debit card was stolen out of my luggage by either the concierge at my hotel or XXXX. I was unaware that it was stolen as I was on a flight ( have proof of me being on a flight ) and could not have been making charges in a country I was no longer in. Upon landing, I received a fraud notification FROM BMO stating that XXXX charges were going to be processed ( others were denied for fraud automatically, have proof of this ) XXXX charge was for {$3000.00} and another for {$86.00} had been made to the same fraud name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I have screenshots of the fraud changes email from BMO ). I promptly called BMO to turn my card off immediately and filed my fraud case once the XXXX fraud charges were posted to my account. When initially on the phone with the BMO agent I said I didn't know if my card was stolen or my account hacked again as I had just gotten off a plane and didn't have my luggage yet. When I got to my luggage and checked, the card was indeed stolen. 

It should also be noted, that the debit card HAD NEVER BEEN used before, these fraud charges were the first and only charges made on the card. Again, these were also initially correctly flagged as fraud by BMO. 

Once the charges were posted I immediately called and filed a fraud case. I did not hear back about my case so on XX/XX/year> I emailed XXXX XXXX to get an update after filing my case. While I did get an automatic response, I have yet to receive an email from an actual person with information about reopening my case. 

While checking my account, I noticed the fraud charge for {$86.00} had been refunded, but for some reason, the larger charge for {$3000.00} had been denied. This is incorrect, I can prove I was on a plane at this time and did not make either of these charges. To try and get help on XX/XX/year> Spoke with XXXX from the BMO resolution team- she never called me back to update me on my case after she said she was following up. 

On XX/XX/year> Follow-up email to Rege.processing to which I received no automatic response, nor a response from an actual person.

07-08-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Short summary : Goldman Sachs ( Apple Card ) is charging me for an order that was cancelled, computer returned to Apple, and the purchase price completely refunded to the card from Apple. After many cycles of disputes and investigations ( Ive sent in full documentation ) by Goldman Sachs they insist that the merchant charges remain. My balance should be XXXX and I should owe them nothing. 

Here is the story from the beginning. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I ordered a XXXX XXXX XXXX with extra RAM. ( total cost was {$1000.00} ) At the time, I responded to the offer to apply for an Apple Card ( Goldman Sachs ) for that purchase and was approved. 


I received the new computer, but it soon become obvious that it was not charging for some reason, so I brought it to my nearby Apple Store to have it looked at.

The specialist at the Apple Store looked at my computer and said that it was XXXX and that it needed to be replaced. They said that Id have to arrange to ship it back t

o Apple myself because it was a custom order with extra RAM which they do not in stock in the stores. Well, went home and called Apple to ar
range the exchange of my computer.

I was able to ship it back, and Apple received my return but after that, something went wrong on Apples end, and I never got my replacement computer.

After several calls with Apple to try to get to the bottom of it, I finally got someone ( a supervisor or manager ) who said that they would just go ahead and completely cancel that order and then I could then go online and just purchase a new computer from scratch. 
I wound up not purchasing a new computer at that time and I soon cancelled my Apple Card. 

The ONLY thing I used the Apple Card for was to order that one laptop which was returned ( along with the gift card I never used ). Again, the order was cancelled and refunded to the card by Apple.

I have documents showing my order, showing that Apple received the return, and that the card was refund was being processed. In addition, I have invoices from apple showing that the entire cost of the computer, Apple Care, and the credit for my trade-in computer was completely refunded to my Apple Card.

Goldman Sachs has continually insisted that I owe them for this computer. I have filed more disputes than I can remember ( at least six ) and have spent more hours on the phone with them than I can possibly add up. I have sent them all the documentation that I have many times, yet they keep coming back at me saying that after investigation, there was no billing error, and the merchant charges will stay on my account. 
This has been going on since last XXXX ( it is now XX/XX/XXXX ). The last time I spoke to anyone at Goldman Sachs I was bounced around on conference calls between Apple and Goldman Sachs for three hours ( Apple confirming the accuracy of my claim ) only to be hung up on by someone at Goldman Sachs who told me that there was nothing that could be done. 

Bottom line is that in the end I never bought anything with my Apple Card and there should be XXXX balance on it. 

There is no other way I can try to remedy this with Goldman Sachs. I keep filing disputes and sending in the proof of my claim and they just keep coming back at me saying that I am wrong and that I owe them for this computer. What else can I do?

11/17/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,On XX/XX/XXXX I had a conversation with Chase Credit Card Services supervisor named XXXX. Their number is XXXX. I disputed a charge I found on my credit card statement that I did not make nor recognize in the amount of {$230.00} at XXXX. I advised XXXX that I still had possession of my card but did not ever recall making that transaction of {$230.00} at XXXX. Ultimately he advised that the charge would stand as valid and I would be responsible for the charge. This is completely wrong. I should not be responsible for charges I did not authorize. He claims that the card has a chip and it was used in store and it is next to impossible for the card to have been used fraudulently. I was offended as it feels as if I am being accused of being a liar and my credit card company is unwilling to assist me in resolving this issue. I am adamant that I did not make this charge and would like for it to be removed as this was fraud. As an XXXX XXXX too often we are not given the benefit of doubt and not deemed not trustworthy even if the dollar amount is so insignificant. I am an upstanding individual with excellent financial record with Chase Credit Card and its quite disappointing to have been treated so unfairly. I am seeking CFPB support to resolve this dispute as I have been honest and did my part to report unauthorized activity on my card in a timely manner. Chase Credit Card purports to offer XXXX liability on fraudulent charges but it seems like it only applies to card holders of certain demographics. This is XXXX and this type of discrimination and arbitrary application of good will is wrong.,,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,FL,33179,,Consent provided,Web,11/17/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7869243.0

The promotion stated that I would receive up to {$300.00} in statement credits for XXXX purchases made with the card. The way the offer was presented clearly implied that the credit could be applied toward the stay I was booking. Based on this understanding, I applied for the card and was approved. 

However, after further review, I discovered that the {$300.00} statement credit is only applicable to purchases made after the card is received, which takes 710 business days to arrive. This timeframe made it impossible to use the credit for my immediate reservation. The promotion was misleading and did not disclose this critical limitation upfront, leading me to believe it could be applied immediately. 

As a result, I am now responsible for an annual fee on a credit card I would not have applied for had the terms been properly disclosed. Additionally, closing the card to avoid the fee would negatively impact my credit score.

The purpose of this letter is to request your intervention and assistance in resolving the matters detailed below. 

I have recently discovered numerous discrepancies on my credit report that involve several creditors. These discrepancies encompass unauthorized credit inquiries, inaccurate account information, and misleading personal data. Through thorough investigation and examination of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), it is evident that my rights have been breached in multiple instances. 

Unauthorized Inquiries : On numerous occasions, I found unauthorized credit inquiries made without my explicit consent. These actions have compromised my personal information and have negatively affected my credit score. These actions directly violate FCRA 604, 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which outlines the permissible purposes for conducting consumer reports. I have provided specific instances and details of these inquiries below : XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccurate Account Information : Moreover, I have encountered inaccurate account information that includes questionable account names and numbers, as well as incorrect payment history reporting. These inaccuracies have substantially affected my creditworthiness and my ability to access fair financial opportunities.

05-08-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Ive been a Chase Sapphire customer for about 2 years now. 

I enrolled in a payment plan by Chase for an Amazon purchase worth {$2800.00} on XXXX XX/XX/2022. The payment was to be made in 18 installments over the course of 18 months.

I was paying off this purchase on schedule and on time till 4 months which amounts to {$630.00}. 

4 months later, I got a refund from United Airlines for some flights I booked through this credit card worth {$1300.00} and this is where the ordeal began. 

Chase claims that any credit/refund which comes into the card, that amount automatically goes towards the payment plan so in this case the credit from United Airlines got applied to the Chase payment plan. 

So in this case, {$2800.00} - {$630.00} ( the payments I made for 4 months ) = {$2200.00}. 

Then apply the credit from United Airlines {$2200.00} - {$1300.00} = ~ {$850.00}. ( Credit from United Airlines ) I continued to make payments every month for the payment plan unbeknownst of the fact that Chase had decided to apply the flight credit automatically to the payment plan. 

Firstly, the claim from Chase that credits are rolled over into your payment plan are bogus. There is no way the system is designed to roll over money into a plan like that unless I explicitly make a payment into the plan on a monthly basis or I decide to pay it off. 

Due to this, I was getting charged interest on my United airlines transactions as their system was considering these transactions as outstanding balances. 

I called Chase after noticing this and they agreed this was a glitch in their system and this shouldnt have happened. I was able to get these interest charges reversed for a total of 4 times. But after 4 months this STILL kept happening and due to circumstances I wasnt able to get on a call with their useless customer service and be kept on hold for long periods of time. 

Due to this I kept getting charged interest for a total of 14-15 months since I got the United refund which amounts to {$190.00} worth of interest. 

We escalated to the Chase Executive Office to get this resolved but no one at Chase seems to care and acknowledge that this was an error on their part and they keep passing this off as something which is how it's supposed to work. Weve also filed a XXXX complaint and that has gone in vain. 

This case is being handled by XXXX from the executive team and his number is XXXX extension XXXX.

I recently engaged in another conversation with them, lasting for approximately 50 minutes. In this call, Wells Fargo informed me that they have initiated the processing of four disputed transactions, providing the following claim IDs : XXXX XXXX XXXX While this may appear to be a step forward, a significant concern remains unresolved. When I inquired whether I would be required to make payments for these pending claims in the next billing cycle, Wells Fargos response was far from satisfactory. Instead of providing a clear answer, they transferred me between multiple departments, leaving me without a resolution. Ultimately, I was informed that these claims are still pending due to allegedly missing documentation. 

I must emphasize that I have diligently followed Wells Fargos prescribed process, reporting each claim over the phone and promptly supplying all requested information based on their inquiries. Despite my full cooperation, they continue to delay and avoid processing these claims. Their assertion that I havent provided necessary information is perplexing, considering that I possess the claim IDs as evidence. 

This situation strongly suggests that Wells Fargo is intentionally delaying resolution, allowing these claims to linger indefinitely. It is evident that their actions do not align with their stated commitment to promptly and transparently resolving disputes. The banks inability to address these claims raises serious concerns about their practices and their dedication to customer service. The potential for them to profit from unresolved claims, especially when they possess the requisite information, is both disheartening and unjust. 

In light of this, I implore the relevant authorities to intervene and oversee Wells Fargos activities. The banks behavior warrants a comprehensive investigation and appropriate measures to ensure they adhere to ethical practices and treat their customers with the respect they deserve.

The next day I received an email stating that the {$190.00} was used for these tickets, the transaction being done by my friend. He does NOT even have Venmo. I called him and told him what happened and so it begins. 
I contacted Venmo via phone and told them I DID NOt authorize this transaction and I would trust this friend with my life! They then put the money back temporarily two days later while they investigated. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, they got back to me DENYING my dispute. Thet stated that if I had any more information to back up my complaint to do so and the would be happy to take another look. 
I sent them EVERYTHING I had including pictures of the conversation starting with the screenshot of this event. 
They replied back on XX/XX/XXXX and denied it again for the second time. Again saying they would take another look and not to reply back to that email. 
Because I never authorized this transaction initially, I withdrew all of my money knowing they were going to take back what they gave. 
I tried opening a new account with new information because I do like Venmo for many reasons. But they somehow new it was me and eventually I made payments for the balance just so I could have this platform. 
Obviously I know I was hacked and think I have proof? The amount is different but on the same day it says that {$220.00} was a transaction against my account from someone in XXXX.I have never even been to XXXX! 
I did not want to stop there. I contacted the attorney generals office here in XXXX and they told me it was an FBI issue? I believe its the ICC which is internet crime complaint.

In all, {$4800.00} ( see account statement attached ) was transferred from my XXXX Checking account to PayPal to cover the fraudulent transactions. I reported the money transfers and debit transactions to PayPal as fraudulent and they opened an investigation. PayPal reversed the money transfers but found the debit transactions as NOT fraudulent. They said I was responsible for the debit transactions totaling {$1900.00} as they were "" consistent with my spending behavior ''. I also reported all the activity to XXXX as fraudulent as that is where the funds originated from that were spent with the newly opened PayPal debit card. I filed a police report with the city of XXXX XXXX, as that is where the theft occurred, and filed an ID theft report with the FTC. XXXX recognized this activity as fraudulent ( the {$4800.00} transferred from XXXX to Paypal ) and withdrew the money from PayPal resulting in a negative {$1900.00} balance in my PayPal account. I spoke with many PayPal customer service agents who agreed that the activity looked appeared fraudulent, and that I should definitely appeal the findings. I did appeal, but PayPal refused to formally recognize the debit transactions as fraud. The amount has now been placed with internal collections and I can no longer appeal the decision as I have already done so. I strongly believe if PayPal were to look at this closer that the activity would most certainly appear as fraud as within a few hours of time, a new debit card was opened on my account and thousands of dollars spent in various ways from my PayPal account. Also, if they could observe video footage of the stores in which this new PayPal debit card was used, they would see that I did NOT enter any of them at the time of the purchases ( or ever ). I have been a PayPal customer for over 15 years and never have spent that kind of money out of my account within such a short amount of time. It is definitely not consistent with my usual activity. How can they recognize the money transfers as fraudulent, but the debit transactions as not?

05/30/25,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Subject : Complaint Against Goldman Sachs Bank USA XXXX Unlawful Account Restriction Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am submitting a formal complaint against Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the issuer of my XXXX XXXX account and Apple Card, for what I believe is a violation of consumer banking rights and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau protections. 

On XX/XX/year>, the bank restricted access to my XXXX XXXX account ( containing {$15000.00} ) and my Apple Card, following a verification call confirming a routine transfer. 
Despite no evidence of fraud or unauthorized activity, the accounts were locked and I was told I would need to wait up to XXXX XXXX business days for an internal review, without any clear explanation or recourse. I called them XXXX more times trying to get someone to a person that can address this without further delay. Each agent told me different stories, from only the back office can release the accounts, they must investigate it which takes XXXX days, the accounts are closed. This was a nightmare and put me in a deep level of emotional and mental stress. 

This incident reflects potential : - Negligence in account handling. 
- Violation of the bank 's own deposit agreement. 
- Unlawful restriction of consumer funds without justifiable cause or notice. 

On XX/XX/year>, just before XXXXXXXX XXXX, I received a call from the bank stating that the restriction had been lifted and for security reasons can not tell me the reason why my accounts were placed on restriction. I have this call recorded and can give it to you. I informed the agent I was recording. This confirms that the bank wrongfully restricted access to my funds for over XXXXXXXX XXXX  which I am sure if I didnt end up calling them the XXXX times I did, they would have taken their XXXX days. When I asked for the reason, none was provided. I explained how harmful this could have been to someone with no other resources-if I had needed money for emergency medication or formula for a child, I would have had no access to it. I expressed to the representative that while I understand necessary fraud holds, this was not the case here. There was no fraud, no suspicious activity, and the bank had verified that all was in order. This restriction should never have occurred and represents a gross operational failure. After multiple escalations and a detailed phone call transcript ( available upon request ), I was informed by a supervisor that they are not able to advise any further information.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  from XXXX XXXX using Samsungs financing option, managed by TD Bank. This purchase was made online, and I received no clear financial agreement or termsthere was no signed contract or agreement disclosed at the time of purchase. 

For over 18 months, I did not receive any statements, notifications, or documentation from TD Bank or XXXX describing the terms of my financing. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received my first statement, followed by another in XXXX, showing an unexpected balance of {$820.00} with a 29.99 % APR. I was never informed of this interest rate or that my financing agreement was allegedly for 18 months, as TD Bank claimed. I have no records of signing or agreeing to this XXXX term, either digitally or physically. 

Despite my numerous attempts to resolve this matter with TD Bank and escalating the issue to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have been met with no resolution. TD Bank has continued to apply unjustified and unethical interest charges to my balance, completely disregarding my efforts to correct their errors. Due to this ongoing unethical behavior and the failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX to protect their customers from these practices, I had no choice but to log into my TD Bank account and pay off the wrongful balance in full to stop the continuous financial harm. 

I am continuing to submit this complaint to request a reasonable and just refund of the unauthorized extra charges I paid, as well as compensation for the significant stress and hardship I have endured throughout this process. 

Furthermore, I have recently learned of TD Banks involvement in unethical practices, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and money laundering, which resulted in a {$1.00} XXXX penalty from the U.S. Department of the Treasurys XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ). This further supports my concerns about TD Banks unethical behavior in my case. 

XXXX, Please review and compare the attached "" Screenshot of My Monthly Statements ( Taken on XXXX ) '', which shows that only XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX statements were available at that time, with the modified version where TD Bank has since added XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX statements after I raised a complaint and provided them with the original screenshot.

02-08-2025,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that my Discover credit card account had been closed due to alleged inactivity. 

Between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I actively managed my Discover credit card account with consistent payments and responsible financial behavior. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a substantial internet payment of {$3000.00}, reflecting my commitment to maintaining the account in good standing. 

This payment, along with other transactions, such as a {$93.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and multiple smaller payments throughout the preceding months, underscores my dedication to fulfilling all financial obligations. 

Additionally, various interest charges were addressed, further demonstrating responsible account management. These actions collectively contributed to a total payments and credits amount of - {$3300.00} during that period. This concerted effort to keep my account current contradicts the rationale for closure based on inactivity or delinquency. 

Reopening of the account was denied by supervisors on XX/XX/XXXX and the Executive Offices contact information was provided that same day. A response from the Executive Offices was initially provided by XXXX via Email on XX/XX/XXXX. A phone call occurred on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX, stating Discover 's investigation was not ruled in my favor and there was no further course of resolution, other than arbitration. 

Concerned about this unexpected closure, I initiated a dispute with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, aiming to clarify any discrepancies related to the closure reasons provided by Discover. 

Upon investigating my dispute, XXXX highlighted several critical findings that support the reopening of my account : 1. Inactivity : Despite Discovers policy of closing accounts after seven months of inactivity, XXXX has verified that transactions occurred within the past year. This evidence directly contradicts the closure based on inactivity. According to XXXX 's standards, any account activity within a year indicates engagement and functionality, challenging Discover 's basis for closure. 

2. Credit Utilization : XXXX identified discrepancies in the reporting of my available credit, showing an impact on utilization ratios. Before the account closure, my credit utilization was below 40 % ( Available credit +60 % ), a misrepresented factor that undermines any justification for closure related to credit limits. 

3. Delinquency : XXXX confirmed that no recent delinquencies were present on my account, with all payments made punctually. The only existing delinquency predates my approval with Discover, which negates non-compliance as a reason for closure. 
XXXX 's ongoing investigation, initiated on [ dispute initiation date ], consistently refutes Discovers closure rationale. 

Additionally, there are potential errors and cardholder agreement violations on Discover 's part : - Notification Requirement : The "" Changes to Your Agreement '' section mandates prior notification for significant account status changes, including closures. However, I was not sufficiently notified, depriving me of the chance to rectify the purported inactivity. 

- Communication Consistency : As per the "" Our Communications with You '' section, timely updates are crucial. The absence of adequate notification regarding inactivity raises further concerns, highlighted by XXXX findings. 

- Account Management through Payments : The "" Paying Interest '' section implies ongoing account activity through substantial payments. My significant payment in XX/XX/XXXX emphasizes responsible management, contradicting any claimed stagnation. 

Given these developments and potential agreement violations, I respectfully request a reassessment of my account closure. I propose an account reinstatement that reflects accurate historical activity and aligns with industry standards.

I thought the problem had been resolved and I just came back to XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2023... .just to find all these past months the City XXXX XXXX Card has been charging me with LATE FEE PAYMENTS and INTEREST CHARGES on the fraudulent charges I had disputed. I have called them 4 times these last week and they keep on transferring me to different departments that just give me the run around and have not resolved the issue in over 4 months. Also, every time I call I get XXXX representatives and it is super hard to understand what they are saying. It is very frustrating trying to speak with them. I should not have to pay for late fees for fraudulent charges I did not make. Every time I call them they transfer me at least XXXX different times to representatives who can not help me and put me on hold for long time at a time. No one has been able to help me solve this matter.

Account Information : * Account Name : XXXX XXXX * Account Type : XXXX Checking Summary of Complaint : I opened a Capital XXXX XXXX checking account in [ XX/XX/XXXX under the understanding that there were no foreign transaction fees associated with the account. Capital XXXXXXXX XXXX website and account materials advertise that XXXX checking accounts allow for debit card use abroad without additional fees as follows : For XXXX products ( XXXX Checking, Money, etc. ) there are no additional fees when you use your debit card abroad ( any transaction made in a foreign currency or that XXXX classifies as a cross-border transaction ). 

However, since moving to XXXX in XXXX [ temporary due to my son studies ], I have been charged foreign transaction fees on all my withdrawals from ATMs. These fees have resulted in a significant difference between the amount withdrawn in Euros ( ) and the amount debited from my account in US Dollars ( $ ). 

Examples of Discrepancies : * XX/XX/XXXX Withdrawal : I withdrew XXXX from a XXXX ATM. However, my account was debited {$650.00}. At the prevailing exchange rate of XXXX to {$1.00} USD, the withdrawal should have only cost approximately {$500.00} USD ( XXXX x XXXX ). This translates to adiscrepancy of {$140.00} USD. 
* * XX/XX/XXXX Withdrawal : Today, I withdrew XXXX from a XXXX ATM. My account was debited {$680.00}. At the current exchange rate of XXXX to {$1.00} USD, the withdrawal should have cost approximately {$550.00} USD ( XXXX x XXXX ). This translates to adiscrepancy of {$120.00} USD. 

On the other hand, this situation have been. Happening Sice XX/XX/XXXX to the present. 
* Actions Taken : I have contacted Capital XXXX customer service on [ Number ] occasions to inquire about these fees. They have not been able to provide a clear explanation or offer any reimbursement for the excessive charges. I specifically mentioned the information on Capital XXXX 's website regarding no foreign transaction fees for XXXX accounts, but this information was not acknowledged by customer service representatives. 

Attached Documentation : I have attached foto screen taken today XX/XX/XXXX for your reference : * The Bank statements are proof, showing the foreign transaction fees and the corresponding debits in USD to my account. If it is necessary I can requests my bank statements, since XXXX, but sending an Auditor to the bank you can verify same. 

Request for Relief : I request that the CFPB investigate these charges and determine if they violate any consumer protection laws. Specifically, I request that Capital XXXX be required to : * Explain the basis for these foreign transaction fees, considering the advertised benefit of "" no foreign transaction fees '' for XXXX checking accounts. 
* Reimburse me for all foreign transaction fees that have been intentionally charged to my account since XXXX, including the discrepancies highlighted in the examples above. 
* Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and a resolution to this issue.

He said that because it was so old they could not properly service it and began trying to sell me a new unit. Its for an area of a XXXX level house under renovation, so we didnt need it, and as long as the unit still worked, we were fine and would just wait until we were ready for the renovations which would not occur for at least a year. He made the deal sound really good but because I know nothing about where it needed to be moved and electrical stuff, my husband came home from work, and XXXX then proceeded to sell us both on a unit, with these requirements specified by us : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Larger capacity AC than what we had in order to provide for the future remodel, which is the entirety of our basement. The old XXXX was XXXX seer and is still sitting outside of our house. 
A permit had to be filed so I could use it on my taxes and the rebate of 30 %. 
I needed the XXXX future rework promise in writing. 
I wanted the plans for where the new unit would be moved as it was complicated and required extensive wiring and changed locations. I wanted upfront pricing of any extra costs associated to be specified before signing the final sales contract. 
I wanted the 10 % discount promised with the Maintenance Program I had signed up with XXXX XXXX, which is why they were at my home in the first place. 

The deal XXXX XXXX presented seemed great, we told him it was contingent on financing, because we didnt actually need a new AC yet, and were not going to pay out of pocket for XXXX a year early. He told us he would need to pull our credit for specifics. I asked what bank. He said XXXX. I laughed because I just got a card from them and told my husband to do the pre approval so I wouldnt get confused with XXXX cards in the same name. XXXX XXXX asked us questions and filled out the information on his XXXX with us both present. My husband signed once via e-sign from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX then went to his car to talk to his manager about the deal and came back and told my husband that he was denied. I had walked upstairs at this point assuming no issues. My husband later called/texted me and said they denied him. He has amazing credit, so I noted that something was very wrong and offered to do the credit myself, while I tried to figure out why my husband with near perfect credit was denied. 

XXXX XXXX then went to his car and came back and said the social security number he entered was wrong. We were suddenly approved for everything. We told him it was no rush and asked that he have those details to us by the following week. 
XXXX XXXX is just an HVAC tech, so this was understandable it would take time to develop the plans required and that a salesman was still needed for the contract and notary as listed on the estimate I signed. We were told it was only a credit application and was needed to confirm rates and terms and before they could proceed with the plans. No loan agreement was ever signed. No sales contract was ever signed. 

We received a Notice of Adverse Action in the mail around XX/XX/2023, I immediately called the number on the form and was told that it was XXXX XXXX XXXX. They did not have any record of me or my husband. My husband received a call from someone later in the day and was told a loan had been made. We immediately denied this. No one has ever signed loan documents or agreed to even a sales contract and I have gotten nowhere with XXXX XXXX XXXX or this bank that has a fraudulent loan pending. No copies of the estimate or the pre-approval was ever provided to us. 

The estimate presented to me did not have the discount, nor details of the specific XXXX unit, nor the specifics of the move and wiring required, but included a price of {$12000.00} with a notary fee of {$50.00}. XXXX XXXX told me that he could not adjust it, but it would proper in the contract that we would sign at a later date when they made the plans. I e-signed on an XXXX presented by XXXX XXXX once. He told me he would have to get with his team because it was beyond his scope. He was just a XXXX XXXX called to our home for regular maintenance. 

After receiving the attached letter in the mail on or around XX/XX/2023, I called the number on the front of the form and was notified that a loan application had been made in my husbands name. I called XXXX XXXX and had my husband call the number again that night which was when we learned there was a pending loan application on file for {$14000.00}, nearly {$2000.00} more than agreed upon in the estimate I e-signed for on XX/XX/2023, with a bunch of incorrect information including income and mortgage payment, never completed or authorized by my husband, and using our house as collateral, dated XX/XX/2023.

As a user of the platform, I am troubled by the allegations that Zelle has not adequately protected consumers from fraud and unauthorized transactions. 

The safety and reliability of a financial service are paramount, and the allegations of Zelle failing to address widespread fraudulent activity raise serious doubts about the platforms commitment to its users. Transparency, swift dispute resolution, and effective consumer protections are essential for maintaining trust, and I feel Zelle has fallen short in these areas. 

Unfortunately, I fell victim to fraudulent activity while using Zelle, and despite reaching out to the team for assistance, I received little to no meaningful help in recovering my funds. 

I urge them to take immediate and concrete steps to enhance consumer protection, improve fraud prevention measures, and communicate these improvements transparently.

11/13/24,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,,"I sent an email to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Head XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Bank XXXX 

START OF EMAIL : Hello, XXXX My accounts were closed by US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, causing me much distress ever since. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX contacted me to inform me that my debit card had failed. When I contacted US Bank support, I was told that they were not allowed to disclose the reason for the closure. They informed me that all of my funds, over {$100000.00}, had been sent to an old mailing address of mine and that I could never open another account at US Bank. This was shocking, especially as I had been a preferred customer for over 40 years! Over the next month I called the support department over 10 times and got differing answers about how I could get my funds returned. Very unprofessional. 

It took me until XX/XX/XXXX to recover my funds. I was in XXXX helping my son start a new business, so I had to fly back to XXXX to sign a Declaration of Loss. As a result of this situation, I missed my XXXX card payment, my Social Security checks were not deposited, and I experienced many other inconveniences, including having no access to my funds while in XXXX. 

Now I have no access to my account records, and my credit is ruined. I tried to open an account at three different banks and was rejected. Finally, I found a bank that would allow me to open accounts : XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. 

Here are my notes during XX/XX/XXXX : US Bank notes XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that my debit card was refused, so I contacted the bank and was routed to a phone where I left a message, but it was not returned I tried again on XX/XX/XXXX and again received no return call I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and finally one of their representatives was able to figure out what had happened but not why. The back office would not tell her why the accounts were closed and that they have the right to close customer accounts for no reason. 
From US BANK Support : In XX/XX/XXXX The wire transfer of {$50000.00} was deemed not in the customers best interest Why?? I had talked with the wire transfer department and had been approved for the transfer and the money did transfer. 
My mailing address was set to an address in XXXX, an old address which I had not updated, my mistake. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, they had closed all of my accounts without any notice to me. 
They then proceeded to write cashiers checks for all of my accounts and mailed them out to the old XXXX address Over {$110000.00} in the accounts The checks have my name on them and you should need an ID to catch them The wire transfer somehow triggered the bank to close all of my accounts and mail cashiers checks to the wrong address I was not notified by email text message nor phone call The support person said I should wait 15 business days and then cancel the cashiers checks and at that time I should be able to get my money back after I go through another procedure where I get a form and have to formally request my money. At that time, it will probably take one to three weeks to get the form to me by mail and another one to three weeks to return it with my signature as I was in XXXX at the time. 
This Support person also said that I will not be able to open another account at US BANK ever again. Why is that? I have done nothing wrong. 
The support rep was not able to explain why this occurred only that it had occurred and she apologized profusely for it I am hoping that the address they sent it to was to XXXX, XXXX  business partner so I can get the checks back So now I have no money and my XXXX payment will bounce and my social security direct deposit will fail. so I called XXXX and let them know the situation and XXXX  seemed OK with it, but I dont know if Ill be charged interest or penalty or whatever or damage my credit rating. I was charged {$45.00} in interest. I had never missed a payment since XXXX when I opened the account. 
How can a bank operate in this manner? Ive been a customer of theirs for 40 years and Im a preferred customer supposedly. 
I believe that I set my mailing address to the XXXX address because XXXX and I were going to XXXX to start a business and for some reason I needed to change the mailing address temporarily, but I never set it back The bank has my email address and my phone number so why didnt they contact me? They just closed my account and sent out the checks with no notification. 
If I do get the cashiers checks back to me, I have no way to deposit them as I have no bank accounts here nor anywhere else Open a new bank account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX debit card XXXX XXXX  All applications rejected due to XXXX now showing the bank closed my accounts. 
Need to get my autopay for SS check redirected to XXXX or XXXX account or a new account for me. I dont know what to do. 
Call bank. XX/XX/XXXX Ok some progress. Called bank again and support rep said she is cancelling the cashiers checks and mail new checks to XXXX. Now well see if she accomplishes it. Yesterdays rep said it is impossible. Fortunately todays rep seemed more knowledgeable. 
We shall see. This rep says she has done it before. 
Department which Closed the accounts XXXX XXXX left another message, no return call Call again XX/XX/XXXX on hold now Im told that they have not started the cancellation and that its in a queue and then will take up to 5 days to execute before they will issue new checks. 
I was referred to the fraud department She promised the checks would arrive at our residence in XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX, and I should call them on the XXXX if we dont receive it. 
What am I supposed to do die here? I have no money. I cant buy a ticket. Im stuck. What should I do? 
XX/XX/XXXX Checks did not arrive XXXX manager : XXXX XXXX XXXX She worked with us and eventually we got the funds back on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I had been told by numerous support people that this was a back office issue and communication with them was difficult as they are not ever allowed to call the back office. They can only email and wait as long as it takes. 
XXXX told me in late XXXX that if I wanted my funds I would have to sign a form in person, a Declaration of Loss. Since Im working in XXXX, that was a huge inconvenience to me. She told me that if I signed the form on XXXX, I would have my checks within a couple of hours. 
I did sign the declaration on XXXX but delayed again by the back office. 
Applied in person at XXXX XXXX  in XXXX Accepted opened checking and savings accounts XXXX visit the bank again - no progress, more promises XX/XX/XXXX visit the bank again - no progress Later that day from XXXX Checks are being overnighted to the bank Tracking number XXXX - XXXX Checks arrived XX/XX/XXXX Deposited at XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  I need their report in order to dispute Request the report mailed to my XXXX address XX/XX/XXXX, still waiting XXXX said she was able to get the back office to tell her why I was canceled. Suspicion of Fraud. Because I did a wire transfer from one United States bank to another, but I did the wire remotely as I was in XXXX. They detected the ip address to be XXXX so suspected fraud. At US Bank you are guilty until proven innocent.

I have received emails from them stating that they have they are providing me a monthly statement but when I click to open those email links, theres nothing there then my savings account reappeared on my dashboard this time with a negative balance because they charged me a monthly maintenance fee.

Despite providing all requested documents, service agreements, business plans, banking, letters of explanation, vendor contracts, answered questions on fulfillment times, cancellation policies, cancellation insurance, brochures, website, social, verified guest transactions, and repeated attempts to resolve this matter through XXXX customer service channels, I have received vague, automated responses and no meaningful explanation as to why my account was permanently limited. 
Background & XXXX  Unjust Actions I operate a legitimate small, family-owned business, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX an event venue in Mississippi, providing an event space for weddings and other special occasions. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX opened for business in XXXX of XXXX and began accepting payments via PayPal for guest bookings in XX/XX/XXXX. 
As our business grew, we expanded our advertising and marketing efforts, including partnering with platforms like XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX + XXXX ), which increased visibility and led to a natural rise in transaction activity. 
Recognizing the influx of payments as a sign of business growth, we proactively complied with XXXX verification requests, submitting weeks worth of documentation confirming transaction details, client agreements, and proof of service fulfillment. 
On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, immediately after complying with instructions from a PayPal representative to have XXXX of our guests check their emails to approve their transactions with XXXX XXXX XXXX and after both approvals were complete, we received an email notification that our account was permanently closed and funds still withheld for 180 days. 
The customer service process has been opaque, lacking human oversight, as responses are largely automated rejections without an avenue for appeal or resolution. 
It is nearly impossible to reach a live representative. The process is frustratingly circularautomated responses direct me to the website, which then directs me back to automated responses, and a beta chat help bot that appears at random and offers nothing but automated selections and responses. 
PayPal automates misleading & contradictory documentation requests. I was required to submit proof of inventory, which is irrelevant to my business as I do not sell physical goods and am categorized under the business type for Hotel/Reservations. PayPal rejected the documentation I provided without an option to explain my business model. PayPal refuses to acknowledge the nature of my business and continues to demand irrelevant documents. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX of Similar Complaints and continued enforcement of arbitrary limitations without due process suggests a pattern of systemic abuse rather than individual risk assessment.

b. Mississippis Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( XXXX ) prohibits businesses from engaging in deceptive, fraudulent, or unfair practices in commerce. PayPal 's vague responses, lack of transparency, and prolonged withholding of my funds without clear justification constitute unfair practices. 
XXXX. Violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) & Regulation E a.

This error originated under Claim number : XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3400.00} and included reimbursement for several fraudulent charges against my business credit card now ending in XXXX ( the previous card was cancelled ). These charges included XXXX {$880.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX {$450.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX {$450.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX {$800.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ).

XXXX subsequently reimbursed BofA {$59.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX {$260.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for which I have a letter form BofA dated XX/XX/XXXX. BofA then subsequently charged {$470.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and {$320.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to my account stating that these accounted for duplicate credits. This is where the error originated as the {$470.00} was never reimbursed by XXXX and therefore is not a duplicate credit.

This offer was the main reason I chose to apply. My credit score, as shown on the Chase app, is XXXX, and I have a perfect payment history. I've never missed a payment on any credit card in my life, with consistent amounts and responsible credit usage. 

I was approved for a credit limit of {$11000.00}, which was great, but after approval, I found out that I wasnt given the 0 % APR for 15 months or the balance transfer offer as promised. Instead, they assigned me an APR of 27 %, and there was no balance transfer option available. This is not what was advertised, and it's very disappointing, especially since my credit score and history meet the criteria for such offers.

I spoke with a customer service agent and a supervisor, and neither of them could give me a clear explanation as to why I didnt receive the promised terms. They mentioned they werent sure if it was a system error but, unfortunately, there was nothing they could do on their end to fix it. This has left me frustrated, as I applied for the card expecting the advertised benefits.

My Wallet was stolen at the time, and my drivers license was also stolen. This would allow an identity thief to use my social security number, and drivers license. At the time of account opening whomever opened the checking and savings account they made several transactions.

Also which was opened as Identity Fraud. Bank of America Denied the Check Fraud claim on this check warrant from the Texas Comptroller stating that the check was deposited into the intended payee 's account and the intended payee benefited from the check. This is false. The Check was deposited into the fraudulent checking account ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a Forgery Affidavit to the State of Texas who forwarded this to Bank of America.

This is my retirement check that I am entitled to. I did not deposit this check into any accounts with Bank of America. I am not sure whom did.

They have given me no reasons for the outcome of their investigation and no other information for their findings. I can not even make contact with them. I have called and asked for an explanation on multiple occasions but will not be put through with anyone in the fraud department. I have asked the service reps what information they need to help them believe me and they have no answer for me. 
They do not seek the truth of the matter. They don't want it to be fraud. They only want to deny and delay and hope that I will go away.

I agreed to help him and he released his phone to me so I could get his bank account information and he also had a Power of Attorney drawn up authorizing me to handle his financial and personal business. I found that the quickest way to access his funds was through XXXX transfers because I also had an account at Chase and he told me that was fine because he wanted his items as quickly as possible. I continued to act on his behalf until he was released in XXXX. All transactions that transpired were per his request. When he was released from jail he began telling me that I 'had to meet him somewhere to go over the bank transactions ' and I told him that I couldn't meet him so he told me that if I did not then he was going to go to the bank and tell them that he believed that some of the transactions were fraudulent. On XX/XX/XXXX he filed XXXX online disputes for amounts totalling {$1800.00} and the bank took that amount out of my checking account, leaving me with a negative amount of {$1800.00}. I discovered the transactions on XX/XX/XXXX when I checked my account balance. I went to the bank that afternoon and a call was made to the fraud department and they said I would have to wait 7-10 days to find out more because they would do an investigation and for me to call them back after that time. I explained to the bank representative that I had a POA and all transactions were done on his behalf. She told me to call the fraud department on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, which I did, but I was told to call back after 10 days. I called fraud department again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that a decision had already been made in favor of XXXX XXXX. I asked why I hadn't been contacted during their supposed investigation and all I was told was 'because it was XXXX and the decision has been made '. On XX/XX/XXXX I called fraud department again and requested a letter explaining their decision and the reasoning for it but I was told they don't do that. 
The only communication I received from Chase Bank regarding this matter was the seven letters informing me that the disputes had been filed against my account. The only other communication was when I called the fraud department. I do not believe that a thorough investigation, if any at all, was done in this case. A decision was made without anyone contacting me. I don't feel that this matter was handled according to law. The other complaint I have is that Chase Bank 's XXXX regulations has a clause that says if a person allows another individual to use their XXXX account then the account holder is responsible for any transactions that are made, so by allowing XXXX XXXX to take that money out of my account should not have happened. I also believe that it's a possibility that XXXX XXXX may have intended to file the disputes to get the money because he had spent more than he thought.

I became aware of this account only after receiving calls from collection agencies referencing a debt owed to Synchrony Bank. I initially believed the calls were a scam, as I had never opened an account with Synchrony Bank. Once the calls persisted, I contacted Synchrony directly and, after providing my personal information, was informed that an account existed under my name. 

I immediately disputed the account and initiated a fraud investigation. Since then, I have filed XXXX separate disputes with Synchrony over a span of months. Each time, Synchrony responded with nearly identical denial letters citing the same reasons : The account has been open for more than 12 months Payments were made The account is in my name I "" authorized, participated in, or benefited from the purchase '' These responses are generic and do not address the specific points I have made in my written rebuttals. I have requested verifiable proof that I opened or used this account, including : A signed application or digital application details ( IP address, device ID, timestamp ) Proof of payments made from my personal bank accounts ( routing/account numbers ) Purchase history and transaction verification Synchrony has failed to provide any of this. Instead, they mailed me generic account statements that simply show activity on the account, with no evidence tying the account to me or my finances. I explicitly told them to cross-reference the payment information with my bank accounts, and they ignored this request. 

Additionally, when calling Synchrony, I am consistently redirected to XXXX XXXX ( the collections agency ) who tells me they can not help. When I attempt to call Synchrony again from my own number, the system disconnects my call after I enter my Social Security number. I have been hung up on multiple times and blocked from accessing real support. 

This entire process has now become a pattern of denial, obstruction, and refusal to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am the victim of identity misuse, and instead of conducting a proper investigation, Synchrony has ignored my rebuttals, avoided meaningful contact, and continued to report the account as valid to the credit bureaus.

Because of this mishandling : My credit score has dropped nearly XXXX points My available credit on legitimate accounts has been reduced My ability to obtain credit, housing, and financial stability has been severely damaged What I Requested : Proof that I opened the account Verification of payments from my personal bank account Application information ( IP address, phone number, signature ) A copy of the account opening method What They Provided : Basic monthly statements showing charges and payments ( no link to me ) Repetitive denial letters with no actual investigation details",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,TX,78666,,Consent provided,Web,07-03-2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,14439828.0

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a small business. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received two payments of {$9800.00} and {$3000.00} through Chase Merchant Services. Following this, the Chase team requested additional verifications, which I promptly completed by submitting the required documents. After successfully passing all verifications, I was informed that my merchant account was in good standing and that I could continue processing payments. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, after receiving a payment of {$9400.00} from a new customer, Chase Bank placed a hold on my merchant account and my business checking accounts. These accounts are essential for my business operations, including paying salaries, covering expenses, and depositing insurance checks for vehicle repairs. Since then, the payout of {$9400.00} has been paused, and my bank accounts at Chase have been frozen. 

Despite my repeated attempts to communicate with Chase regarding the status of this payout and the reasons for the account freeze, I have not received any responses. On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited a local branch and spent approximately three hours discussing this matter with the branch manager. With their assistance, I attempted to reach other departments by phone to resolve the issues with my accounts and merchant services. 

This situation has caused significant inconvenience and financial hardship for my business. The funds in question are urgently needed for ongoing operations, including payments to XXXX for car parts, salaries, rent, and other essential expenses. Currently, my accounts at Chase reflect a total available balance of {$13000.00}, as well as {$12000.00} in my merchant account and pending checks from insurance companies for vehicle repairs. 

Chase Bank has imposed a 180-day hold on my accounts and has treated me in a discriminatory manner during our communications. The only explanation provided for these actions is that they are due to "" security reasons '' stemming from suspicious transaction activity. I would like to emphasize that I maintain a 100 % clean record with my merchant provider and have never had a dispute against my company. I possess comprehensive documentation for all my customers, including receipts, identification verification documents, credit card information, and photographic inspections of all vehicles serviced. 

Therefore, I respectfully request that the CFPB ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ) investigate this matter and assist in facilitating a resolution between myself and Chase Bank. I believe that Chase Bank 's actions have been unjustified and have severely impacted my business operations. 

Attached to this complaint are copies of relevant correspondence and screenshots of communication with Chase Bank, along with supporting documentation from my customers. Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to proceed with this case. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue.

They also claim they could not leave a voicemail. Oddly, several business and personal voicemails have been left during the time span of the supposed calls. I believe these calls did not happen, as the facts do not support it and Fidelity now has a history of failing to communicate with me on matters with this dispute. As they admit in their own response. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue with Fidelity since XX/XX/2023. It has costed me 50+ hours of time, 30-40 calls, and several faxes. The time is invaluable and the calls and faxes have now accrued significant personal cost to me, as I have to pay for each one. 

Fidelity 's behavior on this matter is appalling. They have miscommunicated, misled, and mistreated me during the whole process. I am going to write a 2nd complaint on the same issue, because it is the only way I can get any response out of them and they continue to make false promises and not follow through. 

In order to resolve the dispute I firmly ask that : ( 1 ) A credit for {$2500.00} is immediately issued to my credit card. This amount represents the total disputed amount minus {$130.00} that was previously credit to me. The cost of moving XXXX, booking new ones, throwing away food, changing flights, changing my travel plans, and losing several days does not begin to be covered by this credit. The cost of the XXXX I had to leave due to an illegal invasion of privacy and safety by the host is far higher than my refund. The service was not only not what I paid for, it had significant financial cost to me to fix it. 

( 2 ) I be reimbursed for my time, fees, and communication costs. A 10,000 point gesture is nice, but meaningless when I continue to accrue late fees because Fidelity does not do what it says it will. I have lost significantly more money on this matter than I should have because of Fidelity 's inability to handle it properly. 

( 3 ) Any negative credit reporting for late payment be reversed. I should not be penalized for Fidelity 's mistakes. 

( 4 ) A detailed explanation of why I am being treated this way. I have been a customer with Fidelity for 10+ years, since my first job. I have followed all Fidelity rules, communicate properly, and provided all information asked in a timely and organized manner. Even when I had to call for the 20th time I treated all employees with respect and patience. I have never been angry, unreasonable, or untruthful during this process. Yet, Fidelity lies to me, treats me badly, and does not handle my issue fairly. It has cost me so much time, money, and stress you can not begin to imagine.

( 5 ) Due to Fidelity 's untruthfulness, inability to communicate, and growing cost to me to resolve this, I request all communication be done on CFPB or Fax. I can not trust Fidelity and need written communication from here on out in case this needs to escalated further. I have already told Fidelity numerous times I can not communicate with Mail and they clearly can not communicate over the phone despite my attempts. Since Fidelity refuses to email me, my fax number is XXXX.

06/21/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I accepted a credit card offer from Discover in early XXXX and was approved for a $ XXXX limit. Before my card even arrived, I got calls and emails from the fraud dept. saying to contact them. It looked like a scam since I didn't even get the card yet. They sent the wrong card design, and when I went to activate my new card, Discover refused, stating I had to submit my passport or driver 's license to them first. I said absolutely not, and they said they will close my account then. At no time did they disclose this "" requirement '' before or during the acceptance/approval process. They do not require this from the majority of their customers, and they refused to tell me why they were trying to do it to me. No other credit card has asked me for this, and nobody I spoke to about this had ever heard of such a request either. I explained that they already have my SS #, birthday, and address. If I give them everything I have, I have nothing to fight the hackers the next time Discover has a data breech and hands them a picture to go along with all other forms of identification and DL #. There were many red flags since the automated system repeatedly hung up on me when I tried to get someone on the phone. Then I reached XXXX from the fraud department twice in one day, which is unheard of in a large company with employees in multiple states. XXXX was rude and even claimed asking for a DL or Passport is the same as a bank asking to see a debit card. I said, "" No XXXX, it's not because Discover didn't issue my Driver 's License and a bank issues the debit card they request to see. '' Eventually he admitted I can get a notarized letter to verify my identity so I don't have to submit that information, but that was a lie because the letter requests my license number. In order to obtain a notary 's signature, it is required that you show them your driver 's license. Therefore, obtaining their signature IS verifying your identity. If identity verification is truly what Discover wanted, they would accept that. But they refuse. Also, they can not verify what they do not already have. They never requested my DL # during my approval process, so providing it to them now does not verify their records. However, I actually went to XXXX banks and got XXXX notarized letters that stated I showed them my DL, SS card, Birth Certificate, and my Discover Card ( that they refuse to activate ), and Discover said that is not good enough. I even offered to travel to the nearest office to show my IDs to their employee, but they said they don't have XXXX. ( I was offering to go out of state ). I offered many solutions to further verify myself, but they refused to utilize any ethical business practices, problem-solving skills, or respect to resolve this issue that they created. I told them repeatedly I don't feel comfortable giving them my license # for their files, and asked what else can I do. They kept saying, "" This is our policy. We'll close your account if you don't give it to us. '' They are like kidnappers holding my card for ransom. They hardcore marketed me for 2 years. I chose them over other companies and timed it to do a 0 % balance transfer. They already did a hard pull on my credit. My credit report shows I have $ XXXX more available credit, but Discover refuses to give me access to it. If I apply for another company now ( one that doesn't abuse customers ), it will be another hard pull close together, and the company may reject me because it looks like I have $ XXXX available that I don't really have. If Discover closes my account, that will also damage my credit and reputation. They have refused to do anything to mitigate or ameliorate the damages they have inflicted on me. I asked to speak to the head of the fraud department and they told me they don't give that information out. I asked for a contact name and an email to speak to someone with power and integrity to fix this, and they refused to provide that. XXXX, a supervisor, said I can write a letter to a XXXX XXXX and address it to "" Care Of Complaint Department. '' They kept saying there is nothing I can do except submit information they never disclosed they could request. They are punishing me for not supplying them with information they were not transparent about. That is not even in compliance with Transparency laws. It's also unethical and disreputable. Nobody should ever be maltreated, disrespected, lied to, or deceived by any company the ways Discover has done so to me. This has been extremely shocking, offensive, stressful, and damaging ( credit wise ) dealing with their incompetence and shady practices. My banker thought this was fraud, especially since the letter Discover provided didn't even have their logo on it. She called Discover to see if this is really how they treat their customers. Even XXXX from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warned me this sounded like fraud and this is how scammers treat victims because of the time pressure and threats Discover threw at me.

I have an account with Coinbase.com. There is roughly {$700.00} equivalent in bitcoin in the account. I was advised in XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/XXXX  by Coinbase.com that they were making changes and were closing my account on XX/XX/. Coinbase.com has decided to no longer support certain accounts. Coinbase.com going forward intends to only support accounts from citizens & residents primarily in XXXX and the United States. I understand Coinbase.com is having several problems and that I need to comply and withdraw funds. 

XX/XX/XXXX  was my first attempt to login and withdraw funds as per the XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX  emails from Coinbase.com. During login, I correctly provide username, password, and my device authentication code. I can not currently withdraw the funds in my account because the "" Accept Updated Terms '' process during login is not working properly and keeps cycling through the same click box and dialogue until the session times out or webpage error dialog displays "" Access to www.coinbase.com was denied ; You don't have authorization to view this page ; HTTP Error 403 ''. 

From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/, I tried various ways to resolve matter by logging-in with different devices and with/without VPN, but none of it worked. 

On XX/XX/, I started contacting customer support by email and phone. The customer support via phone says that my account is in an unsupported area. I am a US citizen, but have been residing in XXXX for several years where I created the account. Per Coinbase.com website comments, they are experimenting with customer support, which means they are not supporting certain customers. When I send emails through their customer support, the email support tickets are automatically closed ; sometimes within one or two seconds of sending my support email ( usually within 10 minutes ). This is happening because my account email address is associated to my residency in XXXX, which is an unsupported area per Coinbase.com. 

I reached out to Coinbase.com customer support several times on XX/XX/XXXX  with the same result ( phone hang-ups, phone calls not returned, email support tickets automatically closed ). On XX/XX/, I also reached-out to a Coinbase executive officer, who I know personally from a prior employer ; no response too, but obviously all the execs are very busy with everything going on. In total, I have probably contacted Coinbase.com phone and email support about ten ( 10 ) times with no action from Coinbase.com. 

There should be no such thing as an unsupported area if Coinbase has the customers funds. It seems obvious to me that if a financial institution has customer funds and requested the customer to withdraw funds, Coinbase.com must support those customer accounts with funds whether they are or are not in unsupported areas. Per Coinbase.com emails, I have until XX/XX/XXXX  to withdraw funds, but currently Coinbase.com through their customer support process is preventing me from withdrawing funds with possibly a purposeful lack of support.",,"Coinbase, Inc.",,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/28/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7463902.0

I have been a customer of Navy Federal since XXXX, and I have recently encountered issues that I believe warrant immediate attention. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the Bureau issued an order against Navy Federal for engaging in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau found that from XXXX through XXXX, Navy Federal charged overdraft fees on debit-card purchases and ATM withdrawals when consumers accounts had insufficient funds at the time the transactions settled, despite members having sufficient funds during the transaction. Furthermore, it was noted that Navy Federal was aware that members were unlikely to understand these unexpected overdraft fees.

Additionally, the Bureau identified that, through XX/XX/XXXX, Navy Federal charged overdraft fees when there were delays in posting credits to members accounts from person-to-person payment networks, even when those funds appeared to be available for immediate use to members.

As a direct result of these practices, my checking account has been closed and charged off due to similar issues regarding the illegal charging of overdraft fees. This has caused significant financial distress and damage to my credit report.

I am requesting the following actions : 1. A refund of the overdraft fees that were improperly charged to my account.

2. Reactivation of my closed checking account.

3. Removal of the charge-off from my credit report.

If my request is not fulfilled within 30-45 days, I will be compelled to move forward with the litigation process to seek {$1000.00} in damages for each inaccuracy reflected in my credit report and days without my checking account being reactivated and refunded.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

This situation has persisted since XX/XX/year>, and reflects a severe lack of accountability and transparency between the two entities, causing significant financial and emotional distress.

# # # **Background of the Issue** 1. **Order and Refund Request** : - On XX/XX/year>, I received a defective item ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$140.00} ) from XXXX. 
- A refund request was initiated on XX/XX/year>. XXXX system acknowledged the refund but later canceled it without justification. 
- XXXX customer service repeatedly directed me to contact Bank of America, claiming they "" lack functionality '' to issue returns labels or refunds directly. 

2. **Bank of Americas Role** : - A formal claim ( Claim ID : XXXX ) was filed on XX/XX/year>. Bank of America initially promised a resolution but later denied my claim on XX/XX/year>, citing insufficient evidence of return ( Case # XXXX ). 
- Despite providing proof of delivery and repeated communication, the bank dismissed the claim, stating they "" could not confirm the item was returned, '' even though XXXX failed to provide a returns label. 

3. **Mutual Negligence** : - Both parties have engaged in a cycle of blame-shifting. XXXX insists the bank handles refunds, while Bank of America rejects claims due to XXXX refusal to cooperate. 
- Bank of America falsely asserted that funds were "" already sent back '' ( XX/XX/year> ), yet no refund appears in my account. This delay exceeds 90 days, violating standard dispute resolution timelines. 

# # # **Concerns of Mismanagement** The prolonged negligence raises serious concerns about systemic failures or potential misconduct. Specifically : - **XXXX  refusal to provide a returns label** directly obstructed my ability to comply with Bank of Americas documentation requirements.

- **Bank of Americas dismissal of valid evidence** suggests either procedural incompetence or deliberate disregard for customer rights.

- The unresolved status of {$100.00} ( reduced from {$140.00} without explanation ) indicates possible financial discrepancies requiring investigation.

# # # **Demands for Resolution** 1. Immediate issuance of a **full refund** ( {$140.00} ) by XXXX or Bank of America .

2. Transparent clarification of the {$37.00} discrepancy in the refund amount.

3. A formal apology and assurance that such negligence will not recur.

4. Independent review of both parties dispute processes to address systemic flaws.

# # # **Attached Evidence** - Screenshots of customer service interactions ( Files : XXXX, XXXX ). 
XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX denial letter ( XXXX ). 
- Order and refund details ( XXXX, XXXX ). 

# # # **Conclusion** This situation has caused undue stress and financial harm. I expect a prompt resolution and detailed written response within XXXX business days**. Failure to address this matter will compel me to escalate it to regulatory bodies, including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CFPB ) ** and the **Federal Trade XXXX XXXX FTC ) **.

And that I could just request a transfer and he tells me the amount to put to make sure I get the full balance. 
I wait XXXX business days to have the transfer approved. And nothing happens. 
So I call and I am told "" oh we need a bank statement to confirm that account and then approve the transfer '', although I was not contacted or informed prior to me calling that this was needed or requested. 
I spoke to XXXX who reassures me that she will do make sure this is handled right. She sends me a link to upload the document and I send it back within XXXX mins, I email to let her I know its uploaded. 
She repsonsds that she will get it sent to the approvals team to get it approved and that I will hear back within 2 days. 
2 days go by and I have not heard anything so I email ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and ask why havent I been informed on the status of my transfer. And I am told the transfer is approved and should be deposited within 3 days, I wait the 3 days, still no deposist. So I call my bank and they tell me that they do not see any pending deposists nor do they hold deposits. I call XXXX and ask to speak to speak to a a XXXX, I get XXXX who has no idea why the transfer had not been sent to me, but then tells me that there are holdins I need to put into my pie before I can transfer my money- which no one has told me way before needed to be done.

We do it twice together on the phone, he informs me that he isnt sure why I cant do this action and that he will have to escalate the situation. And here it is XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received any help to getting this resolved. 
This company is hard to get real help with and they do not promptly address issues espcially when it comes to my ability to get things done on my end when my acount wont let me make the changes needed, they have inhibited my abilty to use my account and I do not want my money sitting in tis account anymore. i want liquidate and close the account",,M1 Holdings Inc.,TX,773XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/27/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7611315.0

The CSR states they can't contact the Fraud department for details. This has started over a month ago! I really need my money returned to me ASAP. The previous case number is filed with you is - XXXX See complaint below : I have 2 banks I bank with. 1. XXXX XXXX 2. US Bank I deposited a mobile check for {$1000.00} to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, it sent me a message on XX/XX/XXXX after mobile deposit that it was rejected due to the date being incorrect. My client had accidentally put the date as XXXX. She corrected and initialed it, so I redeposited the same day and it rejected again. ( I have proof of this on my mobile banking app from XXXX XXXX. So, since it rejected twice at XXXX XXXX, I decided to go ahead and mobile deposit it at US Bank, which accepted it. However, Unbeknownst to me, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX went ahead and accepted it, so they deposited it into my account. I of course had already also deposited it into US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX since XXXX showed they rejected it. US Bank, then debited it from my account since it cleared through XXXX XXXX. Which I am totally fine with. I had enough XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX Complaint Detail https : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX money in my account so it didn't go negative. I believe my balance AFTER the {$1000.00} deduction was at {$3900.00} in my business account. Which, I was closing since I know longer have that business. I had opened a personal checking and savings with US Bank, and was trying to transfer my business balance into my new checking via XXXX. Next thing I know, my account was frozen by US Bank and in the Fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX. That department which you can only reach through phone, would not give my any information and I was told there was no time frame on which they had to return my money or and that they also had the discretion to not return any! So, I went into the local branch and spoke to the Branch Manager, who was very helpful, I showed him All of my documents showing how XXXX XXXX rejected my deposit twice, but then 2 days later accepted it. He emailed the fraud department asking for the hold to be removed on XX/XX/XXXX ( the same date I went in to see him ). He called me on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that unfortunately the fraud department rejected his request and they'd be closing out my account and sending me a check in a few days ( I saved this voicemail ), so then I emailed him on XX/XX/XXXX asking if he could please provide me with an ETA, he said he contacted them again via email, and they told him what they told me, they had no specified time on when and if they would return my money. I then called US Bank fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX, and she researched it for me and said it's actually another department handling it ( she said the "" closing department '' ), and she said their last notes on my account dated XX/XX/XXXX, said they were investigating it, there was no specified period on closing or returning my funds. The note also stated, that it would be returned by cashiers check through the mail IF there was any funds to send! I can't even reach that department that supposedly is researching my account to talk with them. That XXXX also told me I would be receiving notice in the mail stating the same thing. I've yet to receive anything after more than 2 weeks. Yesterday, I received a notice in the mail about the {$1000.00} debit which I already was aware of, BUT in that same letter it stated they were looking into a deposit I made on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {>= $1,000,000}!!!! I of course have this notice for proof that US Bank is the one in error. They are the ones that did something on their end. So it appears they flagged MY account for that very large transaction. I've never ever had that kind of money in my life. Nor did I ever make a deposit in that amount! I am just trying to get back my {$3900.00} that I worked very hard to save. I've never bounced anything at US Bank and always had money in it. In addition, the personal checking and savings I had opened online had an initial opening deposit of {$100.00} in checking and {$75.00} in savings. They are denying me that {$170.00} as well. Again, I opened those personal accounts because I closed my business, and was going to transfer the business balance into my personal accounts I had just opened. Due me : {$3900.00} from my sole owner business account, {$100.00} from my new checking and {$75.00} from my new savings. Please help me. I have attached documents supporting my statement.

Summary of the Issue : - On XX/XX/year>2025, I filed a dispute with Chime concerning a charge of {$360.00} made to my account ending in XXXX - The charge was for a deposit paid to a photographer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I believe was unfairly charged because : - The deposit was paid under the impression it was a hold fee to secure a future date, not a nonrefundable payment. 
- No specific date, location, or signed contract was confirmed at the time of payment. 
- I canceled the deposit XXXX days later, before any services were rendered, and was not informed that the deposit was nonrefundable. 
- The photographer has been unresponsive to my attempts to resolve the matter directly and has refused to refund my deposit. 
- Despite multiple attempts to communicate and resolve the dispute, Chime has not reversed the charge or taken appropriate action to protect my consumer rights. 
- I also contacted XXXX and the photographer directly, but found no resolution, and my efforts to get a refund have been ignored or rejected. 

Legal and Consumer Rights Concerns : - Under XXXX  and XXXX  law, deposits paid for services that were not provided and where no signed agreement or clear nonrefundable terms exist are presumed refundable. 
- The lack of transparency and the pressure to pay without a signed contract or confirmed details violate consumer protection laws. 
- Chime 's failure to investigate or reverse this charge despite substantial evidence and a legitimate dispute constitutes a failure to protect my rights as a consumer. 

Supporting documents : - Copies of communication with the photographer and XXXX. 
- Dispute documentation submitted to Chime. 
- Any relevant evidence supporting my claim that the deposit was paid prematurely and was supposed to be refundable. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure my consumer rights are protected.",,Chime Financial Inc,IN,46410,,Consent provided,Web,06-05-2025,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,13903663.0

Cash App has closed my case ( XXXX ) XXXX times without resolution. They falsely claim my transactions were "" authorized, '' despite : XX/XX/year> : {$XXXX} transferred from my XXXX XXXX account. 
XX/XX/year> : {$XXXX} transferred from my XXXX XXXX account. 
Cash App refuses to : Provide evidence of authorization. 
Acknowledge a potential security breach. 
Escalate the case for proper investigation. 
Refund my stolen funds. 
This is not a "" security best practices '' issue. It is fraud. Cash App 's inaction is unacceptable. 

I demand the CFBP intervene and force Cash App to : Conduct a genuine investigation. 
Refund my {$XXXX} immediately. 
Subject : URGENT : Unacceptable Response & Continued Fraud - Cash App & CFPB Failure - Escalation Demanded I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and outrage at Cash App 's response to my previous complaint, as relayed through the CFPB. This response is wholly inadequate and demonstrates a continued pattern of disregard for my legitimate claims of fraud.

Cash App 's Response is Unacceptable : They are attempting to dismiss my specific fraud complaint by referencing a general "" Consent Order '' with the CFPB. This is a transparent attempt to evade responsibility for the direct theft from my account.

They state, "" You do not need to do anything at this time to obtain redress ( including potential compensation ), which also means you do not need to file a complaint with the CFPB. '' This is patronizing and insulting. I have filed a complaint, and I demand a resolution to the specific fraudulent transactions on my account, which are not adequately addressed by a broad consent order.

They provide generic "" helpful information '' requests, despite having already been provided with these details multiple times. This is a clear indication they have not reviewed my case properly.

My Experience with Cash App and the CFPB : This is the FIFTH time Cash App has closed my case without resolution.

The CFPB has proven to be ineffective in holding Cash App accountable. They are allowing Cash App to dismiss legitimate fraud complaints with generic, irrelevant responses.

I have been a victim of unauthorized transactions totaling over {$1800.00}, and Cash App continues to ignore my demands for a refund and a proper investigation.

I demand the following immediately : Direct Action from the CFPB : I demand the CFPB take direct action to investigate Cash App 's handling of my specific fraud complaint. Their reliance on a general consent order is unacceptable.

Cash App Investigation : I demand Cash App conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the unauthorized transactions on my account.

Full Refund : I demand a full refund of the stolen funds to my Wells Fargo account.

Escalation : I demand this case be escalated to the highest level within Cash App.

Accountability : I demand Cash App be held accountable for their repeated dismissals and their failure to protect their customers from fraud.",,"Block, Inc.",OR,97124,,Consent provided,Web,04-01-2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,12748289.0

But I was wrongfully fired from my past employer XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was borrowing money for gas to look for a new job plus for food and certain things. When after a few weeks they took the lending part away and I could no longer see XXXX I owed it so I figured they took my last paycheck since I didnt not get one. And still dont know if the company took it or chime took it. Next I recieved unemployment. Since chime would work and XXXX XXXX wouldnt I still used my chime account for my unemployment. 
I was fired on XX/XX/2023. I recieved my first unemployment check on XX/XX/2023 and realized my back pay wasnt in there. I called the unemployment office and they sent me the correct papars to complete. So Tuesday XX/XX/2023 I spent all evening filling out applications because i desperately needed my back pay to catch up on my bills. Wednesday XX/XX/2023 I recieved my two back pay checks around XXXX pm estimated time and not even a minufe later chime stole my unemployment checks to backpay and settle a debt which I believe is illegal. I thought it was illegal to garnish wages that wasnt a state tax debt, child support or for one other reason that I cant remember off the top of my head at this moment. So basically Chime didnt give me a single warning and took out of {$290.00} they took {$230.00} plus {$11.00} for fees which was the majority of my {$290.00} backpay from unemployment. I think it is wrong to settle debt collection with unemployment and the worse part is I already had another job starting soon on XX/XX/XXXX and was going to use chime but since they didnt wait to take the debt back out of a regular paycheck while also claiming I need to sign up for direct deposit even though I do have my unemployment checks from direct deposited they have screwed me over every way possible. I called them ten times and its always some XXXX person you talk to that doesnt know U.S. Law about unemployment benifits and could care less.

11/29/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened without my consent or knowledge,"I was working on my credit and I was thankful and excited to see my score going up. I had planned on getting one card and possibly a small loan and would work on my credit for a year or two. While at my parents home, I mentioned to my family that my score was going up just as any child would tell their parents to make them proud. I didnt realize it at the time but my brother in law had several of his friends and family over that day but I didnt think I was loud enough for someone to hear that I was being sent credit card offers from capital one, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  and more. I thought I could trust eveyone in the room but there were a few I didnt know. Now I do not know if this is how the fraud started but I do remember talking about Capital one and a couple of other banks sending me card offers because I was excited to see my credit growing after 10 years!! A whole year went by and I didnt know what was going on at all. 

In XX/XX/2022, I found out that a Capital One credit card for the amount of {$300.00} had been opened in XXXX of XXXX, a limit of {$600.00} with XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX  and several credit inquiries preformed on my credit report. The XXXX XXXX account was opened near the same time as capital one. I immediately emailed and told capital one and XXXX XXXX  that I was a victim of fraud. Capital XXXX stated they would send me documentation of any charges and dates but I had to go get information myself. 

I didn't write the companies but I did call and did everything I knew to do but maybe I did something wrong. I say that because now I have charge offs on my credit report for capital XXXX and XXXX  XXXX. The credit collection agencies are XXXX bank for XXXX XXXX for {$410.00} ( a settlement ) and XXXX XXXX Incorporated for Capital One for {$470.00} ( settlement ). 

What do I do now???? I need to get my credit report updated and be able to apply for a credit card that I am being sent preapprovals for as well as a personal loan but this sure has messed things up for me and my credit score is low when I need to be able to make payments on items by getting approved for a card and/or a loan so that I can. Afford the items I need. 

Please let me know what to do.

On the unfortunate day of a robbery, my XXXX with the phone number ending in **** was stolen, along with multiple credit cards and bank debit cards, including my Discover card. Since I hadn't received the official police report at that time, I promptly reported the incident to the police and provided Discover with the police report number Discover assured me that they had reached out to the police department to obtain the police report with number I had given. However, due to the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the theft, I had to take immediate precautionary measures, including changing both my phone number and email address to prevent access to all my financial accounts, including Discover, through apps on the stolen XXXX. 
In XXXX, I filed a fraud claim with Discover for unauthorized charges. They reissued me a new Discover card, but unfortunately, it became compromised due to the transfer of app information through XXXX. It wasn't until 2023 that Discover finally started investigating my fraud claim, which caused significant delays and challenges for me. 
To my dismay, Discover is now refusing to compensate me for the fraud charges and even recharging me for the charges that I had already paid while they were supposed to be investigating my fraud claim. This has not only resulted in financial strain but has also negatively impacted my credit score. I strongly believe that this may be in retaliation for filing a CFPB Report against them Discover has decided to close my account.

I fell victim to theft and fraud, and it destroyed my life, setting me back to XXXX after a year of working day and night, struggling to accumulate funds. About a month ago, I met a girl on XXXX XXXX. She claimed to be from XXXX but currently staying at her father 's house in Hawaii but she lives in Michigan. She told me she runs her own business, does dropshipping, and deals with cryptocurrencies. I expressed my interest in learning about crypto, and she offered to help, suggesting we collaborate to make a significant amount of money. She instructed me to download the Kraken app, and after providing my personal information, she told me to buy XXXX and provided her wallet address. She directed me to use the Kraken app only for buying and to trade on a fake site called XXXX. I opened an account on XXXX and followed her instructions. The first time, she asked me to deposit {$550.00} in XX/XX/year>. I did so using Kraken, and we conducted some trading. I won {$100.00} in profit, and she suggested I deposit it into my bank account. Little did I know, it was all part of the scam. Days later, she said the market was favorable, and we needed to do more trading. She proposed a large amount in XX/XX/year>, {$45000.00} from her and {$4500.00} from me. I accepted the challenge, bought XXXX on Kraken, and withdrew it to the wallet address on XXXX, her fake account. When I lost access to XXXX, I found all the funds were fake money, and the site was fraudulent as well. We did several trades, supposedly winning {$200000.00}, but it was all fake. When I asked her to send me my share to my Kraken account, she said okay and asked for screenshots of every step. Then she sent an email from XXXX, claiming I needed to pay {$10000.00}, 5 % of the profit, and in the email they tell me need to pay before XX/XX/year>XXXX  and they provoke me if i dont pay the taxes NIIT i Dont receive my funds. When I explained I didn't have the money, she insisted I find it on my own or take out a loan. The email she sent later was about personal income taxes, stating I had to pay them before XX/XX/XXXX or face penalties. I had {$7000.00}, sent it to my Kraken account, and withdrew it to the wallet address on my XXXX account, her fake account. When I asked her to send me her share, she claimed her mother couldn't send the money due to an emergency. Everything turned out to be fake. I have her number and many pictures of her, even a recorded video call. Please, please, please help me identify this person and report her to the police. I just want to recover my funds, even though I know they won't be fully compensated for the year of hard work and sacrifices. Help me prevent her from exploiting others.

On or about XX/XX/year>, a transaction from my account was duplicated in error. 
Although the duplicated amount had previously been reversed, on XX/XX/year>, the same amount was withdrawn a third time without authorization, on XX/XX/year>. I personally visited the BOA branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/year>, at which time you personally acknowledged the mistake made by a BOA. We both confirmed that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had previously faxed a lien order, on XX/XX/year>. I paid the lien balance, in full, on XX/XX/year>. On XX/XX/year>, I had also notified both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, via a faxed statement and receipt, that my personal property tax balance had been paid in full. On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX faxed proof of this payment to BOA, who subsequently reversed the charge on my account, in the amount of {$640.00}. It was later discovered by both you and BOAs Legal Team, that an identical copy of the lien order had also been received via XXXX and mistakenly misinterpreted as a secondary lien. On XX/XX/year>, I returned to BOAs XXXX XXXX XXXX branch, to speak with you and follow up on the status of my reimbursement. 
Upon acknowledgement of this error, you credited my account, in the amount of {$640.00}, on XX/XX/year>. To my surprise, your institution withdrew $ XXXX my account, for a third time, XX/XX/year>. I immediately contacted your branch office, on the morning of XX/XX/year>, and spoke with the covering XXXX, who made no attempt to resolve this matter. I also contacted BOAs Customer Service Department, via phone that evening, and after over an hour of dispute, the representative acknowledged the withdrawal error ; however, I was denied reimbursement of the funds that were deducted from my account, without my consent, on XX/XX/year>. These negligent acts placed my family under extreme financial hardship, leaving me without the ability to pay bills timely, afford gas for my vehicles and purchase groceries for myself and my XXXX children. 
These actions are not only unacceptable but also violate provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), 15 U.S. Code 1693, which prohibits unauthorized electronic fund transfers and mandates prompt investigation and resolution of transaction disputes. Additionally, your failure to maintain proper transaction handling constitutes negligence, conversion, and a breach of contract under Virginia state law. 

As a result of these actions, I am seeking the following : XXXX. Refund of all wrongfully withdrawn funds, totaling {$640.00}. 
XXXX. Statutory damages under the EFTA ( 15 U.S. Code 1693m ), in the amount of {$1000.00}, for this negligent violation and the willful and repeated mishandling of my account. 
XXXX. Actual damages, including any overdraft fees, bounced payments, or credit impacts, estimated at a minimum of {$500.00}. 
XXXX. Reimbursement of legal fees, as permitted under consumer protection laws. 

You are hereby given XXXX calendar days from the date of this letter to fully resolve this matter by issuing the full refund and providing written assurance that no further unauthorized withdrawals will occur. Failure to resolve this matter within the stated timeframe will leave me no choice but to initiate legal action in civil court, including but not limited to, claims under the EFTA, breach of contract, and applicable state consumer protection statutes. 
This letter serves as a final good faith attempt to resolve this matter prior to litigation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",VA,23116,,Consent provided,Web,04-12-2025,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,12940154.0

My name is XXXX XXXX, and my date of birth is XX/XX/year>. My phone number is XXXX. 

I was deeply disturbed to learn about Citibank 's discriminatory practices against individuals of Armenian descent, particularly in the XXXX area, which have been addressed by your bureau. As an XXXX  with the last name "" XXXX, '' I believe my accounts were closed as a direct result of this discrimination, despite my exemplary credit history and strong relationship with the bank. 

Throughout my time as a Citibank customer, I have maintained exceptional credit and have never missed a payment. My accounts have consistently been in good standing, with no recent high balances or excessive inquiries. It is perplexing and unjust that Citibank would choose to close my accounts without any valid reason. 

I urge you to review my account and the circumstances surrounding its closure. If Citibank does not reopen my accounts, I am prepared to join the class action lawsuit being filed by XXXX XXXX. I have documentation proving my exceptional credit history and will provide this to XXXX XXXX to demonstrate that the closure of my accounts is a result of discrimination. 

I am requesting that Citibank reconsider its decision and reopen my accounts. I would prefer to resolve this matter amicably and without resorting to legal action. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Congress said I have the right to decide what I deem private. I deem my hard inquiry and account information to be private and I DO NOT WANT THIS INFORMATION SHARED ON MY CREDIT REPORT.

FDCPA 807 misleading false reporting THE INFORMATION YOU ARE REPORTING WOULD LEAD A FUTURE CREDITOR TO BELIEVE I APPLIED FOR ALL THESE INQUIRIES & accounts, when in reality it wasn't me, it was a scammer. Reporting these false things is very misleading. You are in violation because you did not witness me sign for these inquiries or accounts, so you can't actually verify that they are accurate, but yet you still reported these things to my credit report which goes against the FCRA laws for FAIRNESS.

15 USC 1681 n Civil liability for willful noncompliance You willfully accepted this credit information about me without verifying with your own two eyes that it was me who applied for this credit. Willful compliance is punishable up to {$1000.00} per violation.

18 U.S. Code 1028A - Aggravated identity theft You shared my information with numerous creditors without getting my consent first. you are criminally liable for aggravated identity theft which is punishable for up to 2 years.

15 U.S. Code 6802 ( b ) 1 ( ) ( a ) ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information DIDN'T DISCLOSE TO ME THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS INFORMATION BEING SHARED. THAT WAS VERY deceptive OF YOU. You never explained to me that I can exercise a nondisclosure option. I feel like my consumer rights have been violated, and I have been taken advantage of.

FDCPA 8012 furnishing deceptive forms You furnished these inaccurate inquiries and accounts as if they were accurate when they were never validated according to GAAP, so you don't even know if these accounts are accurate, but yet you still took it upon yourself to report this inaccurate information.

Also, you reported that I owe a 'debt ', but nowhere on my credit report do I see a Negative balance, ( I don't see a negative sign in front of any numbers, only positive ). By you telling me I owe a "" debt '', but reporting positive balances to my credit report is very deceptive.

15 U.S. Code 1692f. Unfair practices A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.

There is no law that says I have to pay a bill.

( 8 ) Using any language or symbol, other than the debt collector 's address, on any envelope when communicating with a consumer by use of the mails or by telegram, except that a debt collector may use his business name if such name does not indicate that he is in the debt collection business.

This company sent letters to me with a LOGO on it instead of their address. That is a SYMBOL that they are a debt Collection business.

15 U.S. Code 1602 - Definitions and rules of construction ( e ) The term "" person '' means a natural person or an organization.

( f ) The term "" credit '' means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment.

Under 15 USC 1681s-2 this agency is in violation because they furnished information relating to me to the consumer that was inaccurate. I told them that this was inaccurate and they still reported it to my credit report.

I AM THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND I DO NOT GRANT YOU THE RIGHT TO DEFER ANY PAYMENTS TO ME. 15 U.S Code 1681 a ( 4 ) Consumer Right to privacy You are reporting very private matters on my credit report. The FCRA says that the consumer has sole say so over matters I deem to be private to me. I happen to find matters about where I APPLIED TO, AND WHO I "" OWE '' MONEY TO, to be very private.

After a few hours I was told that it had been completed. Two days later however the receiving bank still has not received it. 
I spoke to MULTIPLE call agents, In the online banking department and in the fraud department to figure out what was going on. Absolutely No one informed me that my wire was being held up because I needed to verify my fathers identity. Not only his identity but his place of birth and nationality. Why? because his name was in the memo. Only my fathers name was flagged and not my husbands. My fathers name is XXXX XXXX and my husbands name is XXXX XXXX. I absolutely feel like it was held up due to the discrimination against my fathers name. 
I was on the phone with your customer service representative for over XXXX hours trying to figure out what was going on and all I was told was that it was completed. When I asked to be transferred to the wire department I was told that they would not take my call. So I hung up and immediately called them directly and thats when they informed me why it was being held. After 3 days of calling and XXXX hour long phone call NONE of your other representative told me this. ABSOLUTELY NONE. I went into the bank today to verify as i was advised to by your representative and AGAIN i was told the same issue that they have no idea what is going on and why. My funds still have not been released, They can not provide me with a Federal Reference number that I have requested MULTIPLE times. 
If I had been told by any of your representatives that the reason my wire was being held up was because I needed to verify my fathers identity and his immigration status I would have done it IMMEDIATELY. 
I was wiring funds to a title company. The fact that your company chose to hold my funds and flag my wire simply because of my fathers name is absolutely discrimination. There was absolutely no hold or verification needed for my husband whose name sounded white. But since my fathers name sounded XXXX it was held. 
Your customer service representative have been less then helpful and ive been given the run around for 3 days! 3! This is absolutely ridiculous. I was scheduled to close on my house XX/XX/XXXX and send the funds to close on XX/XX/XXXX! Had I known the reasoning behind why it would have been resolved the same day but absolutely NONE the customer representatives are on the same page and can tell me where my money is.

I contacted them multiple times asking for an explanation, and no one provided a clear or valid reason. I never received any written notice of closure or charge-off. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I began receiving harassing phone calls from a debt collector using the number XXXX, claiming to be collecting on behalf of Citibank. They stated that the account had been placed into collections, and the amount they claimed I owed was higher than my original credit limit, which I believe is inaccurate and possibly unlawful. 

I have never received any written notice from the collector within 5 days of initial contact, as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I requested full written debt validation, including : XXXX. The original account balance breakdown XXXX. Proof the collector is legally authorized to collect on behalf of Citibank XXXX. The date of charge-off XXXX. Documentation explaining the inflated balance XXXX. A written reason for why the account was closed I also demanded that all communications be made in writing due to the repeated, unwanted, and harassing phone calls. 

These actions including failure to validate the debt, harassing phone calls, and potentially misreporting the amount owed appear to violate the FDCPA and may constitute willful violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) if this debt is reported to the credit bureaus without proper validation.

I am documenting all contact, and if this issue is not resolved immediately, I am prepared to pursue legal action for damages under both the FDCPA and FCRA. I am asking for : 1. Immediate withdrawal of this debt from collections 2. Written confirmation that it will not be reported to any credit bureau XXXX.

An FBI agent who contacted me informed me that multiple accounts of mine had been compromised. I indicated that the individual or company responsible has been federally charged and provided a police report I filed earlier this year, along with court documents that clearly outline how the company has defrauded several credit cards, totaling over {$230000.00}. Despite this evidence, my claim with Capital One was denied. 

The subsequent denial I received stated that my claim was rejected because I continued to make payments on the account after the fraudulent transaction occurred. I explained that I made these payments to avoid my account going into collections, which would jeopardize my account status. I have experienced this with another account, negatively affecting my credit, which is crucial for making significant purchases in my life. 

Despite my persistent efforts and concerns, Capital One denied my claim based on date restrictions. Initially, I accepted this decision until I spoke with a close friend who is also a victim in this case. When she filed a claim for a charge dated XX/XX/XXXX, her claim was approved without issue.

03/16/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"Subject : Urgent Request for Investigation and Full Refund of Fraudulent Transactions Linked to My PayPal and XXXX XXXX XXXX  Accounts Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to seek the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) in addressing a serious issue involving unauthorized transactions through my PayPal account , which subsequently affected my linked XXXX XXXX XXXX  account. Despite attempts to resolve this matter directly with both PayPal and XXXX XXXX XXXX, my disputes have been unjustly denied, leaving me without restitution for the significant financial loss I have suffered. Summary of the Incident : As a loyal PayPal user for over five years, I was alarmed to discover that my IRS tax refund had been illicitly withdrawn in multiple transactions, each exceeding {$100.00}. This fraudulent activity was not immediately apparent to PayPal 's security systems, leading to a significant breach of my financial security. Upon discovering these unauthorized transactions, I acted swiftly to contact the recipients, informing them of the situation, which resulted in the return of the funds to my PayPal account. These funds were then transferred back to my XXXX XXXX XXXX  account. Despite these efforts to mitigate the damages, both PayPal and XXXX XXXX XXXX  have denied my claims for a refund. Points of Dispute : Flawed Transaction History Analysis : My dispute with PayPal was denied under the pretense that the transactions matched my usual activity. This ignores the reality that the transactions were unauthorized, highlighting a significant oversight in PayPal 's fraud detection measures. Recurring Security Breaches : This incident is the third instance of unauthorized access to my account, underscoring a recurring vulnerability that PayPal has failed to adequately address. I informed PayPal that the transactions starting around XX/XX/XXXX were unauthorized transactions. The account that my funds were being transferred to has been sending money to their account and then when I reported it they sent the money back two times. I did not file a claim initially because I received my funds back on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from this account. I have been using PayPal for years and never experienced any issues so I did not understand what was going on but since my funds were returned I did not file a claim at the time. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, the same name started receiving money from my PayPal account again. Starting with {$50.00} transfers on XX/XX/XXXX and moving up to {$100.00} transfers and {$150.00} transfers until XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed and filled the claim. PayPal has denied my claim stating no unauthorized use and transaction history ignoring the fact that every transfer to this account has been unauthorized and my PayPal account has been hacked and accessed somehow. I have done my research and have concluded that the people running this scam understand the PayPal system so they know to create transaction history by pulling money from someone's account and sending it back a few times so the system thinks that the accounts have a relationship. After that is done they drain a person 's account and if they receive enough funds before it is reported and they get the money out of their account the scam has worked. XXXX XXXX XXXX  's Non-compliance : Despite having a zero-liability policy for unauthorized transactions, XXXX XXXX XXXX has also denied my claim, refusing to refund the fraudulently withdrawn funds. This failure to honor their policy compounds the financial injury I have experienced. Proactive Security Measures : In response to these breaches, I have severed the link between my PayPal and XXXX XXXX XXXX  accounts to prevent further unauthorized access, albeit after the fact. This decision reflects my diminished trust in both entities ' security protocols. Request for Resolution : In light of XXXX XXXX XXXX 's refusal to honor its zero-liability policy and PayPal 's inadequate response to this breach of security, I am requesting a full refund of the compromised amounts from both institutions. I urge the CFPB to initiate a thorough investigation into the fraudulent activity associated with my accounts and the subsequent handling of my disputes by PayPal and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Your immediate attention to this matter is critical, not only for the recovery of my funds but also to address potential systemic issues within these financial services that jeopardize consumer protection and trust. I am fully prepared to cooperate with your investigation and provide any additional information required. I appreciate your prompt response to this urgent matter. Around {$2100.00} was taken.

# # # **Regulatory Violations : ** The mishandling of my dispute has resulted in several serious regulatory violations : 1. **Regulation E ( Electronic Fund Transfer Act - EFTA ) : ** - **Failure to Investigate in a Timely Manner : ** Regulation E requires financial institutions to investigate disputes within **10 business days** and issue **provisional credit** if further investigation is necessary. Dave ignored my claim and did not conduct a proper investigation within the required timeframe. 
- **Failure to Provide Provisional Credit : ** Even when more time is required for investigation, Regulation E mandates provisional credit be provided to the consumer within **10 business days**. I never received any provisional credit for the disputed transactions. 

2. **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Regulations : ** - **Failure to Provide Transparency : ** Under CFPB guidelines, institutions must maintain clear communication with consumers during dispute resolution. Dave failed to keep me informed of the status of my claim and ignored my repeated attempts to dispute the fraudulent charges. 

3. **Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Data Security Guidelines : ** - **Breach of Data Security : ** My personal and financial information was stolen and used for fraudulent transactions, suggesting that Dave failed to properly secure my data in violation of the FTCs data security guidelines. 

4. **Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : ** - **Failure to Address the Dispute Fairly : ** The FCBA mandates fair treatment of consumers disputing charges. Daves mishandling of my claim, denial based on false information, and lack of proper investigation likely constitute violations of my rights under the FCBA. 

# # # **Request for Immediate Action : ** I request that the CFPB take action to ensure that Dave properly addresses my dispute and resolves the following issues : - **Thorough Reinvestigation** of my claim, including the fraudulent transactions that were incorrectly categorized as undisputed. 
- **Refund of $ XXXX for the unauthorized transactions. 
- Issuance of **provisional credit** in accordance with **Regulation E**. 
- Assurance that **accurate information** ( my correct address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX ) is used for any future claims. 

I have attached copies of all correspondence between myself and Dave customer support, which demonstrate my repeated efforts to report these fraudulent charges and Daves failure to properly address them. I am also attaching documentation that proves my correct address and the fact that I was not in XXXX when the fraudulent charges occurred. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt investigation and resolution of my complaint.

As a long-time account holder at NFCU, I should have had access to authentication services of my personal signature for Securities I need to execute as per the U.S. SEC Medallion Standards that banks ( security transfer agents ) in the program must follow. On XX/XX/, I visited the branch listed above and spoke to manager/vice-president representative ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) seeking to have my signature guaranteed for endorsing a NOTE ( security ) for a securities transfer. As stated on the medallion requirements, the bank ( securities transfer agents ) simply needed to : 1 ) Validate my identity via a valid government-issued I.D . ( which I provided and to verify my account at NFCU ), and 2 ) Stamp my signature to certify its authenticity. However, XXXX refused service to me and said NFCU does not offer anything related to medallion signature guarantees or guarantees on NOTES ( securities ) and that NFCU issued a publication stating this 2-months ago. I indicated that as an account holder, I have no records of such publication, and when I requested a copy to inspect said publication, XXXX refused to supply me with a copy. XXXX actions on behalf of NFCU violates the SECs medallion signature guarantee program rules. XXXX refused to show me any supporting documentation or publication or policies or forms related to the types of NFCU medallion guarantee services they provide per my request which severely lacks transparency and, XXXX and XXXX  equity as a securities transfer agency. In fact, XXXX said the following to me yeah, we turn a lot of these requests away for a medallion signature guarantee because people come in with the wrong documents. We have not provided a medallion signature guarantee in like 6-months or longer. This denial of my basic request as a customer of NFCU left me penalized, costing me unnecessary hassle and financial constraints finding medallion signature guarantee services elsewhere that I should have had full eligibility for on XX/XX/ at NFCU. My case warrants regulatory investigation and penalties since service were improperly denied. As an eligible NFCU account holder and member, NFCU needs to justify why I can not avail medallion signature guarantees of my signature on legal negotiable instruments ( securities - NOTE ) under established medallion signature programs it governs. Comparable to a public notary, the notary doesn't authenticate the legal validity of the specimen per se, but it authenticates the signature of the person that is endorsing the contract as valid and true. The medallion signature guarantee is guaranteeing my signature is authentic as I endorse it on a Security. Per 31 CFR 363.43, I respectfully request the CFPB to compel NFCU to explain this denial, provide transparency on NFCU medallion signature guaranteed policies, demonstrate I was not unfairly deprived of this standard service as a XXXX woman, provide me the medallion signature guarantee I need, and deliver training to ensure equal and fair access of this service to rendered to all regardless of XXXX XXXX XXXX  moving forward.

I am filing a complaint against Cash App ( Block , Inc. ) due to inadequate customer service, unfair practices, and failure to comply with federal consumer protection laws, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), and Regulation E.

They failed to conduct a thorough and good-faith investigation, leaving me without proper recourse or reimbursement for disputed transactions.

In Complaint Case # XXXX, when I opened one checking and one saving account on the same day, I expected to receive a {$300.00} new checking promotional bonus and a {$520.00} new savings promotional bonus. However, after waiting the required 90 days, I only received the {$300.00} promotional bonus for my new checking account, but the {$520.00} still hasn't arrived. 
I contacted Wells Fargo three times seeking answers. 
The first contact was via phone with a customer representative and I was told that I would not have the required balance at the end of the first period. This is not true. The second contact was with the branch manager in XXXX CA, XXXX XXXX, and was told that I was only eligible for one of the two promotional bonuses, under the terms "" You have received any other consumer savings offer bonus or promotional rate that required a bonus offer code within the past 12 months. She even called the authorities and spoke with a representative who confirmed what she had just told me. I told her that even though what you said was true, why did Wells Fargo chose to give me a bonus of {$300.00}? instead of {$520.00}. There is a difference of {$220.00} between the two. She said she could send a message asking why Wells Fargo gave me {$300.00} instead of {$520.00}. She kept telling me that even though I opened a savings account and a checking account at the same time, I only can get one of two promotional bonuses. She ruled out other possibilities such as slow payment processing. and insisted that I just could get one promotional bonus within 12 months. 
I completely disagreed with XXXX. So my third contact with Wells Fargo was through efpb. After more than two months of waiting for further research from them, XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo sent me an email on XX/XX/XXXX stating, "" After further research, we were able to confirm that you were eligible for a promotion bonus offer for of {$520.00}, when opening a Wells Fargo XXXX Savings account. '' However, they were unable to deposit the {$520.00} into my new savings account because I did not keep the account open within 30 days of meeting all the offer requirements. 
XXXX also said : "" We also spoke to the branch XXXX and they advised that they offered to look into the missing bonus payments but you requested closure. '' I totally disagreed with XXXX. The reasons are as follows. 
1. ) The branch manager XXXX said I would only get one of the two promotional bonuses. She told me she did not know why I just got # XXXX instead of {$520.00} either. She said she could send a message to the Authority to ask why Wells Fargo picked the least bonus of {$300.00}, not the highest XXXX {$520.00}. The missing bonus payout XXXX wanted to research was {$220.00}, not the full bonus of {$520.00}. 

2. ) XXXX blames me for not waiting 30 days instead of blaming your branch manager for misleading the customer by providing wrong information. This is irresponsible and ridiculous. 
You have admitted that I was eligible for a {$520.00} promotional bonus when I opened a Wells Fargo XXXX Savings Account. 
Your answer is completely opposite to the answer I got from the branch manager. 

The thing is- if the branch manger ever told me I was eligible for {$520.00} and would receive it in 30 days, I would be willing to wait and not close the savings account, but instead of doing that, she called and talked to a representative to try and convince me that what she was telling me was the truth -- I am not eligible for {$520.00} promotional bonus. In this case, whats the point of keeping a savings account? 
I chose to trust your branch manager, but now XXXX is using my trust as an excuse to not give me the {$520.00} bonus I earned.

Specific Issues and Potential Violations : Over the past several months, I have encountered the following significant problems with my account : Non-receipt of a replacement debit card : Despite repeated requests and assurances, I have not received a replacement debit card, causing significant inconvenience and hindering my ability to access my funds. This constitute a violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer ( EFT ) Act, which requires financial institutions to conduct electronic fund transfers in a timely and accurate manner. 

Unexplained closure of my account : Without prior notice or explanation, my account was abruptly closed, effectively limiting my access to my own funds. This action potentially violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which imposes specific requirements on banks before taking adverse actions against a customer 's account. 

Lack of transparency and unresponsive customer service : Despite numerous attempts to resolve these issues through customer service channels, I have been met with inadequate responses, transfers between representatives, and a persistent lack of clarity regarding the reasons behind the account closure and ongoing review. This lack of transparency may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which requires creditors to communicate fairly and accurately with consumers. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA does indeed regulate how banks and other entities use and report credit information. Before taking adverse actions based on information in a consumer report ( such as closing an account ), the bank must provide the consumer with a notice, including the specific information upon which the adverse action is based. The consumer has the right to review and dispute this information. 

State Laws : These laws vary by state but may prohibit unfair or deceptive practices, ensuring that banks follow proper procedures and provide consumers with notice before closing an account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,NY,11203,,Consent provided,Web,01-12-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8162247.0

Due to work reasons, I needed to extend my stay in the US. I searched for hotels on XXXX and was recommended XXXX to book my room. After booking and submitting my PayPal information, I received notifications from my credit card bank indicating charges. I received two text messages indicating identical charges, and my total credit card balance decreased, which made me suspect a double charge. I immediately reported this to PayPal. Without my consent, PayPal canceled my payment to the hotel booking platform. However, I was unaware that my booking was canceled until the day before I was supposed to check in, when I checked the hotel information and found my reservation had been canceled. Since my hotel booking was non-refundable, I immediately called the hotel platform. The platform advised me to contact PayPal. When I contacted PayPal, they did not resolve the issue. I received an email from the hotel platform and immediately replied, requesting that my reservation not be canceled. I explained that the cancellation was done by PayPal without my consent. Despite my attempts, I never received a response from the hotel platform, only repeated identical email messages from them, which ultimately led to my inability to check into the hotel.

I have made multiple attempts to contact PayPal and submitted my refund request, but to this day, the issue remains unresolved. PayPal has never seriously investigated or understood the problem, merely inquiring about my order with the hotel platform. The cancellation of the order was not initiated by me but was processed by PayPal without my consent, leading to my inability to stay at the hotel. I now demand that PayPal refund the hotel charges for the stay I was unable to complete and apologize for their negligence in handling this matter.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,06/25/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9335964.0

03/23/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"I filed my taxes with XXXX XXXX and had the funds put into Credit Karma. After funds had been deposited I was getting phone calls at odd hours back to back saying it was credit karma. I looked on my account and nothing looked off, so I contacted CK via phone directly through the app and told them about the phone calls and asked them if they wanted the information that was being sent to me. They told me not to worry about it not to answer or respond that I had nothing to worry about. A week later I started getting text messages along with the phone calls pulled my account and everything looked fine. Then voicemails after voicemails this was around XXXX. Text messages were saying did I authorize this and that charge showing the last 4 digits of an account number that I knew was not mine so I ignored it, was absolutely harassing by now I had to turn my phone off because it was back to back. Within minutes of the calls and texts ending I pulled my account back up and all my money was gone. Contacted CK again and I didnt know what was real or fake anymore was transferred to different departments asking to take a photo with my license and face verified my phone number every time stayed on the phone for hours to be told there was nothing I could do because they were pending charges so I had to wait and call back when they went through. Couple days later they went through spent hours waiting on hold retold the story over and over. Going through my account I noticed under my personal information in the phone number section the phone number only showed the last 4 digits and it was not my number it had been changed but every time I called I was asked to verify my phone number and that was never even noticed by CK which let my information go to whoever and could have been resolved whenever I called to report it the first time. So whenever I was getting phone calls and messages it was from both CK and a scammer and being I was told to ignore it it was the real CK and the scammer at the same time approving the transactions they let it all go through back to back for some AiJeans Cash App. Looking into it MYSELF further I seen a virtual card on my account with the last 4 digits of the card that had been being used the whole time which is different than my physical card, this was never addressed from the CK fraud department as well when speaking to them all they talked about was my physical card more or less accusing me of losing it or letting someone use it. I took pictures of everything from day 1. I was denied the disputes then all of a sudden the money is back in the account and all I have received was they are sorry. I cant even access the funds not because I dont have or even want another card from them and they want to charge me a fee to transfer it out to my bank account which I do not want to link to them. I feel like this is being brushed off and Im not letting it go being my tax information bank information my childrens information from my taxes are all at risk now. Now looking at the account on CK there is no place for phone number information to be edited or added, but I took pictures of the false number at the time and a picture of when I changed it back to my number, so I know they are aware of something and trying to cover it. Something needs to be done!! I have spent weeks now trying to figure out what to do, Ive had to delete every account that I have linked to any money services because I dont trust anything anymore. I couldnt pay my bills, I couldnt get an answer from anyone on what the issue really is.

On XX/XX/year> Regions Bank closed my account without prior notice, citing a report from the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( EWS ) system. While I understand banks have the right to close accounts, I was not engaged in any fraudulent or suspicious activity and was not given a clear explanation beyond the EWS reference. 

At the time of the closure, my account had a balance of approximately {$4100.00} I have not received these funds in the form of a check or deposit, and I have received no formal communication from Regions Bank detailing the steps being taken to return my money. I am also facing hardship. I have filed a formal request to both the XXXX XXXX of Regions bank and My local XXXX XXXX. All I have been told is that this is a EWS issue and that I should call. I called and requested my consumer report but that doesnt negate that I am out of funds. 

I have attempted to contact Regions Banks customer service, but I have not received a satisfactory response or timeline for the return of my funds. I am growing increasingly concerned that my money is being withheld without justification or due process. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that Regions Bank : Provides a full explanation for the account closure ; Returns the {$4100.00} balance promptly ; Offers transparency regarding any delays or investigations, if applicable.

01-08-2025,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"Subject : Unjust Overdraft Fee Despite Resolving Negative Balance Before Grace Period Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/XXXX, a transaction of {$2100.00} was processed from my Wells Fargo checking account ( account ending in XXXX ). At the time, the full amount was not available in my account, resulting in a negative balance of {$360.00}. 

To address this, I deposited {$380.00} into my account on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX  which cleared the negative balance and left a positive balance of approximately {$17.00}. I received an email from Wells Fargo confirming that I had until XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  to resolve the negative balance to avoid a {$35.00} overdraft fee. Since my account was brought to a positive balance well before the grace period ended, I should not have been charged this fee. 

Despite this, I was charged the {$35.00} overdraft fee on XX/XX/XXXX, even though my account had a positive balance before the deadline. When I contacted Wells Fargo about this issue, they claimed that the fee was due to pending transactions ( e.g., XXXX purchases ). However, these transactions were already reflected in my available balance at the time, meaning the explanation they provided does not justify the fee. 

This is not the first time Wells Fargo has charged unjust overdraft fees on my account. This demonstrates that they are employing deceptive and manipulative banking practices to maximize overdraft fees. Wells Fargo has a history of class-action lawsuits for these same practices, most notably in XXXX, when they were ordered to pay {$200.00} XXXX for manipulating transaction postings to maximize overdraft fees. The current situation reflects that Wells Fargo has refused to comply with fair banking practices and continues to use the same tricky and predatory practices that led to legal action in the past. 

It is clear that Wells Fargo is exploiting its customers by reintroducing these manipulative practices, which were previously deemed unlawful. This is a systemic issue that not only affects me but also likely affects many other Wells Fargo customers. 

Timeline of Events : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : A transaction of {$2100.00} caused a negative balance of {$360.00}. 
XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : A deposit of {$380.00} was made at XXXXXXXX XXXX, bringing my balance to a positive {$17.00}. 
XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : I received an email stating that I would incur a {$35.00} overdraft fee if the negative balance was not resolved by XXXXXXXX XXXX that day. 
Despite my account being positive well before the deadline, I was charged the {$35.00} fee. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Wells Fargo representatives explained the fee was due to pending transactions, but their reasoning is flawed as the pending transactions were already deducted from my available balance. 

Why This is Unjust : The email from Wells Fargo clearly states that I would avoid the overdraft fee if my account balance was positive by the grace period deadline of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I met this requirement. 
Pending transactions, such as XXXX, were already reflected in the available balance when I resolved the negative balance. Wells Fargos explanation is therefore incorrect and misleading.

Wells Fargos behavior demonstrates a refusal to comply with fair banking practices and echoes the same issues from their XXXX class-action lawsuit, where they were penalized for manipulating transaction postings to maximize overdraft fees. 

This fee appears to be the result of a system error or deliberate manipulation, and it violates the terms outlined in their communication. 

Requested Resolution : 1. Immediate Refund : Refund the {$35.00} overdraft fee charged to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. Investigation into Practices : Investigate Wells Fargos handling of overdraft fees to ensure this does not happen to other customers.

3. Assurance of Compliance : Ensure Wells Fargo adheres to its stated overdraft fee policies and grace period terms moving forward.

Supporting Evidence : Transaction records showing the {$2100.00} debit, the {$380.00} deposit, and my positive balance on XX/XX/XXXX.

01/16/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"This is an appeal Hello, I am wtiting to appeal this false decision and these false accusations. Citi can not just falsely close someones accounts and ruin their life when they are the ones who reach out to make sure. I am a human being and this is someones life. I have been extremely patient and spent so much time but this is not a decision I will accept as 1. It is false and 2. It negatively affects my life. 3. Even the credit line management team acknowledged it was an error and verified indeed I called multiple time to get the disputes cancelled and make my account secure but indeed employees did not follow through. They said that in order to get the security risk removed and my XXXX  Citibank credit cards reopened would be through you since they already handed it ofer to the executive response team.

Please see important points below and please get my XXXX Citibank Credit Cards Reopened as soon as possible and this errored security risk flag removed as well. Thank you.

1. I used the charges specifically for Citibank as I get rewards from either the merchant or the bank for certain stores.

2. I personally inquired on why the charges were gone as some purchases just got bounced back and I was either not getting my stuff in the mail or services and subscriptions getting cancelled.

3. I am obviously an exemplary customer per one of your bankers due to my perfect payment history paying ahead of time and more than my full balance ( not even just the minimum payment ).

4. I was patient and took all the steps to get Citibanks error fixed and account reopened but no one is listening to me. Its as if they do not want to waste their time. For example the representative started the investigation in the evening XXXX  and gave me a false generic response XXXX XXXXXXXX. She promised she will due her due diligence to help me but she did not.

5. Obviously my relationship has been great up until this error by Citibank due to your customer service or dispute team who did not follow through anything. My mistake for not documenting or getting reference numbers but of course that should still be on the representatives fault.

6. Instead of doing an internal root cause analysis for your company, you are closing someones XXXX  accounts in error.

7. I specifically requested time and time again that if these are all online like you claim then remove this feature. However no one is willing to work with me.

8. I placed additional security on my phone, social, two factor authentications, and others and yet still no one is willing to work with me despite my over decade relationship with Citi that was positive until this errored incident by one of your team members or departments.

9. Time and time again multiple representstives have confirmed that I requested any disputes that were placed on my account be cancelled. Some maybe misheard me while others maybe heard me and did not follow through.
10. I have been very kind and patient this far but most people I spoke to were very short and slight me which I find unprofessional. Moreover they are giving me things from XXXX  that were resolved unrelated to anything else and again notes that there was an error.

11. Instead of being rewarded for reaching out to clarify the charges aside from XXXX  are mine, you are ruining my life to avoid doing a root cause analysis for your company.
12. I spent so much time and money including getting postage stamps and sending multiple letters, multiple emails, multiple phone calls, and multiple outreaches, yet no one is helping me.

13. Like I mentioned time and time again that I am willing to work with Citibank to have additional security measures more than I already have added that I mentioned to ensure the security of my account.

14. I have a longstanding relationship with Citibank and I am disheartened by this false error. This should not have happened. 

15. You are sending me something from XXXX  that was also an error removed and this obviously is unrelated to the mistake you made this year. 

XXXX. Even the credit line management team acknowledged it was an error and verified indeed I called multiple time to get the disputes cancelled and make my account secure but indeed employees did not follow through. They said that in order to get the security risk removed and my XXXX Citibank credit cards reopened would be through you since they already handed it ofer to the executive response team.

17. I am requesting the reopen of my XXXX ( XXXX ) Citibank credit cards immediately that were falsely closed in error and the reasons provided are all false and not true and remove this false security risk as this is more of an employee risk. Thank you.

18. I would like someone to reach out to me to get my XXXX Citibank Credit Cards reopened ( including the team who falsely closed it ). I would like communication by phone to notify me that my XXXX Citibank accounts were reopened and the errored security risk was removed. 

Thank you, and see letter attached please.

I talked to two different people, the first I called about a lost card, the 2nd i called about fraudulent charges. When i spoke to one of them, apparently I said I was in possession of the card still. the reason I looked at my Wells Fargo account was because of a denied transaction notification or low funds notification while i was at work. There I saw 10 charges that were unauthorized and immediately after work called and reported it. They denied the claim saying I said i still had the card, so they deemed the charges not fraudulent.

Our bookkeeper is in 2 days per week and we look at this account about 3 times per week. This withdrawal was discovered less than 48 hours after it happened. 

I reported it and was told that it had t be turned in within 24 hours or a "" stop payment '' to be done. 

My reaction was How would I do that if I was unaware and that that 24 hours is NOT a reasonable expectation of discovery. I had told Wells Fargo that I had also tried to contact XXXX  XXXX, whom would NOT speak to me as I was NOT a customer. So I filed a formal complaint as instructed. 

Original Claim filed XX/XX/XXXX NOTES on File : XXXX XXXX can not provide any information regarding this claim Contacted on XX/XX/XXXX within 48 hours of charge Contact XXXX  XXXX and they could not tell me anything or numbers to match WE did not initiate or authorize this charge. 

I waited 7 business days and then a Call placed : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX then XXXX at XXXX XXXX escalating up the chain. 
Was told I had to deny before charge went thruHow can I do that if I knew nothing of the charge Yet she assured me that it would be taken care of and a serious matter as we are "" Valued Customers '' and it should be cleared up within 10 days. Here is my Reference # XXXX Claim number They told me they had investigated back to XX/XX/XXXX verifying this vendor had NEVER been used by our business before and the gal than admitted that "" maybe a typo and they will continue to investigate '' I questioned her as to what this meant and that it was a recorded call and that I would like to be moved to the next level up. I was on this chain of calls for a total of 57 minutes and then when they got me to the last person who asked again for the 4th time after explaining to the last 3 people ; he put me on hold and then the line disconnected. 

Out of pure frustration, I again called XXXX XXXX Dispute line and was on HOLD XXXX min xfer to Business Department to NO Avail ... I was ran through the calling tree and without being a banking customer was NEVER able to get a live person. 

I waited a couple days, hoping that Wells Fargo would at least attempt to contact me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX attempted another call and again went through the phone chain and this time they created a client care ticket number # XXXX to get a response which could take up to 120 days. However, this person suggested that I "" close '' and reopen my account so this does not happen again ... ..I was enraged by this statement and actually considered closing it permanently. However, the inconvenience of this with a small business and running and operating that would be very difficult with current resources and staff. 

I then placed another call : XX/XX/XXXX for a status update, as I had heard nothing to date. They said they tried to call and I had NO RECORD on my phone of a missed call from either Wells Fargo or an unknown XXXX number since my last communication. I spoke to XXXX, who sent me to claims specialist.Reggie and he recorded my issue and assured me someone would be in contact with me. 


Hearing nothing by XX/XX/XXXX, I placed another call and spoke to XXXXThank You for being a valued client and I told her that "" NO MESSAGE WAS EVER LEFT '' and she sent me to XXXX ; the Customer Advocacy Team and he filed a Complaint Department Form filled out and that it would be dealt with in 2 biz days... 

REPEAT of Previous and I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING .... 

So I contacted them again to get a "" Claim Update '' ... .3 days later ( 1 day after they said it would be dealt with and XXXX assured me that it was being worked on today and contacting the other bank and I again provided information and waited. She actually suggested to check the next day if I didn't hear anything... 

GUESS WHAT. I never heard from them so... 


XX/XX/XXXX I called again and XXXX sent me right to XXXX XXXX & "" XXXX '' filed an additional complaint. 

I waited until Friday XX/XX/XXXX and was told my claim was being worked on and we should hear in next few days...

09/14/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I rented a car from XXXX in XXXX, XXXX with my family. I picked the car up at the airport in XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the car had a flat tire. The equipment ( tire jack, etc ) to change the tire was missing from the car. We called XXXX customer support and were asked to wait for more than XXXX hours. We had to wait in the sun without access to water. I was with my XXXX old son and XXXX  parents. 

When the technician arrived to change the tire, he commented on the fact that the tires were extremely worn and in dangerous condition. The unsafe condition of the tires can be seen in the images that XXXX shared. The tires show significant wear and lack of proper maintenance over an extended period, rather than damage from our single rental of 4 days and limited use of the vehicle. 

After the tire had been changed and later in the day on XX/XX/XXXX, an XXXX representative called me and instructed me to return the vehicle early due to it being "" unfit to drive. '' We returned the vehicle to the XXXX office at XXXX XXXX and were given another vehicle and returned the new rental the following day XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was charged {$1200.00} by XXXX. The rental was originally quoted at a price of {$270.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I alerted XXXX to the incorrect charge and filed a dispute with HSBC which manages my credit card. XXXX did not respond with documentation or an invoice until XXXX XXXX 115 days after the rental occurred. 

My complaint is not about XXXX, it is about HSBC - the financial institution with which I communicate regarding credit card charges. 

HSBC told me on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST that they had issued a chargeback ( credit ) for the {$960.00} charge from XXXX XXXX I had contested. HSBC claims that the {$960.00} credit was posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The statement that I have enclosed here does not show the chargeback ( credit ), nor does any other HSBC statement. HSBC has shared no evidence or documentation of the chargeback. 

In XXXX, HSBC determined the XXXX charge was legitimate but did not share the documentation with me that led to their decision. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX agreed with my concerns about the rental and issued a credit of XXXX to my HSBC credit card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), HSBC posted a charge from XXXX for {$960.00} to my credit card. I made the mistake of assuming that this charge was the result of XXXX charging me incorrectly for the XXXX rental. The XX/XX/XXXX charge was not due to XXXX ; the XX/XX/XXXX charge was due to HSBC. HSBC was reversing the XX/XX/XXXX chargeback ( credit ) with a debit of the same amount. But the XX/XX/XXXX credit never occurred, so instead - due to HSBC - I have been charged an *additional* {$960.00}. 

I was charged {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and I was charged {$960.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for the same transaction. HSBC 's intent with the XX/XX/XXXX charge was to reverse a credit, but the credit was never made to my account. In summary, my credit card bill has been charged {$960.00} more than it should be, due to HSBC 's failure to properly document and execute chargebacks and manage disputes.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,DC,20002,,Consent provided,Web,09/14/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10122842.0

He signed me up for XXXX 's 24 month, no interest due if paid within that time period. 
There were multiple delays on their part and so as the months went forward and the project was not started, ( but I was being charged and making payments to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Synchrony ) I asked XXXX to cancel the project. 
I then received a call from XXXX XXXX, asking me to speak to "" XXXX '' he said the store XXXX. He said that she had news that I would be glad to hear. I called XXXX and she told me that XXXX would reduce the price of the project {$2000.00}. if I would go ahead with it. So I agreed and they came and built the deck and did a fine job I continued to make my payment when due without fail. 
Then a year ago, last XXXX ( XXXX ) I called Synchrony and asked the Customer Service Representative what the payoff amount would be on the Deferred Interest Account, as I wanted to pay it off. She gave me an amount of {$11000.00}. I told her that I would be transferring that amount to Synchrony to pay off the XXXX XXXX account only. ( Because I had a regular account, ( that is not a Deferred Interest account ) that I was paying on also, that was separate from the Deferred Interest account that I was paying off and I wanted no mistake to be made. I intended that the {$11000.00} be used only to pay off the XXXX XXXX account. I also made a payment of {$210.00}, which was the payment due for that month on the other account. I asked the Representative to be sure that the money would be managed between the XXXX accounts in that way and she assured me that it would be. I continued to make my monthly payments in the amount that Synchrony sent me each month, thinking that the XXXX XXXX account was paid in full. ( Synchrony doesn't send a full statement per month on the accounts, only the payment amount. ) But then when I received my XX/XX/XXXX statement for XXXX, I discovered that I was being charged the full 24 month interest amount of {$6600.00} as though the Deferred Interest account had not been paid off! 
I contacted Synchrony Bank several times, to be only transferred from XXXX representative to another. No one could offer any solutions, except XXXX did say that the {$11000.00} was partially applied to the "" regular '' account. I asked at XXXX point to speak to a supervisor, and she said that it would take up to 60 days to review my account. I have not heard XXXX word from them. No correspondence from them either. 
I have continued to make the large payments each month, even though they are charging me interest upon the XXXX XXXX .... I've made the payments. 
Now in addition to my original complaint, I've discovered that without my permission, XXXX 's cashiers have put XXXX different purchase amounts into XXXX XXXX accounts!

05-02-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Credit Card Company : Aspire The Company did some drastic changes to my account and I can not use my card any longer. 1. Changes to APRs that are already ridiculously high from 29.99 % to 32.99 % for purchases, 32.99 % to 35.99 % for cash advances. 2. Addition of Account Maintenace Fee of {$60.00} annually ( billed at {$5.00} per month ). I DO NOT know how CFPB could tolerate these increases when the consumer are suffering from the FED rate increases whose objective was to curve inflation!!! This is totally insane/evil and consumer will just suffer!!! 

YOUR OPTIONS : ( 1 ) If you decline their changes, they will peg the interest rate at that high level and close your account and you continue to pay at that high rate. They peg it because they know that the FED will start lowering the interest rate now that inflation is somewhat tamed. SMART MOVE hey! 

( 2 ) If you accept the changes, they will impose a maintenance fee of {$60.00} per year. 

So, CFPB do you see how those 2 options given to consumers are both ripping us off? Both options are in favor of the COMPANY, and the consumer is always at the losing end .... XXXX! I wish one of the options that they have given would at least be in favor of the consumers. But neither does!! ANALYZE IT CFPB ... DO NOT BE A LAME DUCK JUST SITTING OUT THERE.

He said he had credit and to open a business credit card he would use me as a guarantor since I had good credit. He told me that everything would be in his name and I don't have to worry about it. We go to the bank and we sign some documents, he provides some documents with the teller and they step away and they start to speak XXXX. I am told that XXXX would come back for the card and that was that. I received nothing in the mail I received nothing that TD Bank said a credit was open in your name, becuase I was led to believe that the account was opened in his name and he would get all the documents, there was not even a credit card issued for me. While searching for insurance payments on another legal case I decided to go on tdbank to see if I can access my bank accounts. XXXX and behold a maxed out credit with my name with purchases XXXX made ( personal not business ). I contacted XXXX about the maxed credit card and he lied saying that he just purchased a phone with it and everything is in his name. I immediately ended contact with him and proceed to contact the police report this as fraud and contact all 3 credit bureaus. I have made a police complaint on XX/XX/23 but till this day I never got the police report or a detective call me about the case. XXXX is still working on the issue while XXXX and XXXX said it was a joint account and told me to refile once I get a police report. TD Bank fraud would not let me access anything about the account and told me to go to the bank I opened it in. On XX/XX/23 I go there and they said that everything was opened in my name, and refused to provide additional information about other accounts it was tied to or the business entity itself of which I could not find online. They said XXXX was an authorized user. How can it be the primary owner was never issued a card but so called authroized user with bad credit is allowed to XXXX out the card and TD bank does not think anything of it.

11/28/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the handling of my recent concerns regarding my American Express Platinum Card. I believe the practices involved in this matter are unfair, deceptive, and not reflective of the high standards I associate with American Express.

1. Unclear Card Fee : I was charged a card fee that was not transparently disclosed to me. As a Platinum Cardholder, I expect full transparency regarding all associated costs. The lack of clarity surrounding this fee has left me feeling misled and undervalued as a customer ; nor were the restrictions of card feee refunds made clear to me upon r
enewal.

2. Forced Downgrade : When I attempted to cancel my Platinum Card, I was informed that I could not receive a refund for the unused portion of my membership fee. Instead, I was forced to downgrade to another product as the only available option. This left me feeling pressured and trapped in a financial product I did not wish to keep.

3. Denial of Pro-Rata Refund : Despite my efforts to cancel the card outright, I was denied a pro-rata refund for the unused portion of my membership fee. It is unreasonable to charge for a service I no longer wish to use, especially when the decision to downgrade was not made voluntarily but as a result of restrictive policies.

4. Difficult Cancellation Process : The cancellation process itself was unnecessarily complex and felt designed to discourage customers from exercising their right to cancel. This added to my frustration and tarnished my perception of American Expresss commitment to customer satisfaction. Long-winded method to another team, asking multiple questions and not completing the request. 

During this process, I spoke to a representative named XXXX through the American Express chat service. While XXXX attempted to assist me, the outcome of our conversation did not address my concerns adequately and left me feeling further dissatisfied. 

Given these issues, I am requesting the following actions to resolve this matter : 1. A refund of the card fee in question.

2. A pro-rata refund for the unused portion of my Platinum Card membership fee.

3. A review of your cancellation and downgrade policies to ensure a fair and transparent process for all customers.

The inability to cancel outright without financial loss, coupled with the forced downgrade, feels coercive and contrary to ethical business practices. I trust that American Express values its customers and their concerns and will take prompt action to resolve this matter.

I expect to hear back from you within seven business days with a resolution. Please contact me at [ your contact information ] if additional details are required. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,NY,10038,,Consent provided,Web,11/28/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10959006.0

08/28/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/year> I used the website XXXX to reserve a cabin in XXXX, TN for a family vacation at the mountains checking in XX/XX/XXXX, checking out XX/XX/XXXX for the total amount of {$6700.00} that I paid using my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card. When we showed up at the cabin on XX/XX/XXXX we encountered that the cabin was not in the condition promised, to start with, the property manager called me stating that the cabin wasnt going to be ready at the checking time of XXXX as promised so our family we had to hang out somewhere else until they were done cleaning the cabin. Later that day around XXXX we got to the cabin and noticed that I was given the wrong access code to the cabin and we were locked out the place until I called the property manager and she provided her personal code for us to access. We are in the cabin and noticed how dirty it was, trash was still in the trash cans, the floors were filthy and the water to the whole house smelled like rotten eggs. I communicated all of the issues to the property manager and she did resolve some of them but not all. One of the main issues es the water in the hot tub, there was oil floating on top, white flakes floating in the water and even some toenails, I made the property manager aware and she sent someone the next day to overflow the hot tub in order for the oil to spill out, not change the water, only overflow it which did not resolve the issue. Many other complaints were made to the property manager I cant list or explain all of them but I have photos, videos and messages from the property manager to prove all and each of them. A couple of days before we were to check out my sister ( one of the guests at the cabin ) started having a bad headache, we run to the store and got XXXX thinking it was something simple, the next day she got worse and started running a fever, we still didnt think any of it and the next day we were checking out so she planned on going to the doctor when home. The day we checked out since we drove separate vehicles my sister and her family went a different way, we were getting close to home when her husband calls me to tell me that he is taking her to the emergency room because her fever is really high, she is shaking and XXXX is no longer working. I remember talking to her the day before and we were trying to figure out what was going on. She told me that she got in the hot tub and when she was going in, she noticed the tub was slimy and she slipped and fall, she didnt worry about it because she didnt hit herself but she ended up going underwater for a few seconds, she got out and didnt go back in. She made it to the hospital and was told that she had a bad XXXX XXXX because she had XXXX in her ears caused by dirty water, the water in the hot tub, she was at the hospital two days where she was given XXXX for the pain because it was so bad. I immediately contacted XXXX to let them know what was going on and asked for a partial refund so to all the struggles we went through at the cabin and more than anything to compensate for what my sister was going through. I told them I wanted to help her pay the hospital bill since I felt guilty for what had happened to her. It was quite a fight and after back and forward emails with XXXX, unanswered messages to the host/owner XXXX XXXXs and property manager XXXX, XXXX ended up refunding me the service fee of {$770.00}, they were not able to refund the rest because the host/owner used a third party managing company ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) to charge for the rest of the balance which was {$5900.00} so I had to deal with them directly which doesnt not make sense since I used the XXXX platform for the reservation and thought they were the ones handling everything but anyway I dealt with the host as well, I sent several messages through XXXX website because I didnt have a direct number, I didnt have a number for the property managing company, the only thing I have is the phone number to the property manager XXXX but according to her she doesnt deal with refunds, the host/owner XXXX XXXX handles that but he doesnt answer messages and there is not a phone number where I can reach him directly. I also filed a claim through my bank since I could not get a hold of the host/owner but days after Wells Fargo closed the dispute alleging that they provided the service they promised a cabin, I guess the filthy status of the cabin did not matter, it didnt matter that someone ended up at the hospital due to this. I called the bank and argued that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX didnt provide the service they promised, because they promised a clean cabin, a timely check in time, clean premises with all essentials included and they did not kept the promise sending someone to the hospital. Wells Fargo had proof of everything, photos, videos, messages, descriptions, etc. I argued that in one of the message conversations with property manager XXXX, she even admits that the cabin is not in good condition to be rented and I believe this conversation was not taken into consideration, I believe Wells Fargo back just jumped into the conclusion that a cabin was provided and that was it, they close the case with an unfavorable decision against me. At this time after all the wasted time with the bank I kept fighting with XXXX and this time I didnt want a partial refund, I wanted ALL my money back {$5900.00} we fought for a while and finally on XX/XX/year> I received a message from the host on XXXX website that reads the following Weve processed your refund. It may take up to 15 days for this refund to reflect in your original for of payment. Please contact your bank for further updates. I felt relief and waited for the money to post to my Wells Fargo Credit Card account. The date today is XX/XX/year> and the money is still not in my account. XXXX suggested to initiate a chargeback process with my bank Wells Fargo but they argued that this cant be done because the dispute is being closed. I also messaged the host to find out whats going on and got no answer. According to XXXX, they contacted him as well and they did get a response from him, this is what the email from XXXX reads I am contacting you as agreed in the previous email to inform you that the last request sent to the property manager to confirm the refund has been answered and they, as those responsible for the property, have denied that they will process any refund of the rental payment. After promising a refund back in XX/XX/XXXX, they backed up and now they dont want to refund the money. I am really disappointed, specially with my bank Wells Fargo, I have been banking with them for more than 20 years and they cant even fight this for me. The bank, the host/owner, the property manager and XXXX  are getting away with this, really?? Where are we as customers left in a situation like this? I know that my sisters hospital bill will be higher that the full refund I am requesting, I feel guilty and obligated to help her with the expenses and this refund will definitely help us. Wells Fargo Bank has evidence of all issues with the cabin, including photos, videos, screenshots of conversations with property manager XXXX and with host/owner XXXX XXXX XXXX photos of my sister at the hospital showing dates, they had all the evidence that proved that XXXX violated their Book With Confidence Guarantee mentioned in their website. I want to believe that you will make the right decision in this matter and protect a customer that at this time feels like no one cares about.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,280XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/28/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9948761.0

This didn't make sense to me because the application clearly stated "" SSN / ITIN ( Enter your social Security number or Individual Tax Identification Number ''. 

I told him if that's the case, then there shouldnt have been a section for ITIN as this is misleading and should be taken down immediately. The best I can assume a reasonable support personnel would do or say is U.S. Bank would probably investigate this form and probably make necessary corrections or adjustments. As a business owner myself, my websites and application form should not mislead my partners and customers. And if there happens to be some sort of misleading information, I think its worth investigating. 

So, I asked him, what if after submitting my application, then I get a hard pull on my credit reports and I call U.S. Bank and the response is "" sorry no ITINs ''. His response was there wasn't a hard pull so that justifies the unprofessional services I has personally received from U.S. Bank Business Section.

What is more vexing in this matter is that, I applied for a personal secured credit card online around XXXX, XXXX. Filled a form online that also clearly stated "" SSN / ITIN ''. Was approved and serving its purpose. 

So, unless this personnel from U.S. Bank this that I am an XXXX or is simply another ignorant banker I have come across during my recent years in the United States.

He noted the bank 's website had a feature to compare my current product 's interest rate to new product 's, but that this feature was not available in-app or communicated to me proactively. He also noted interest rates are available in account details when logged in, and on statements ( not currently mailed but available when logged in ). However, he agreed that a reasonable consumer would expect their interest rate to adjust due to the Fed and market rates. XXXX also agreed that 0.30 % is not in line with any savings accounts offered by Capital One or its competitors at this time. 

In short, Capital One created a new savings account with an extremely similar name that has reasonable rates and failed to notify existing savings account customers that this was a different product and that they should no longer expect reasonable rates. Capital One did not offer the ability to roll into the new product or in any way communicate that the customer would stop receiving APY increases if they remain with the 360 Savings account. 

Capital One experienced significant bank gain at the expense of customers for under-providing interest for years by a significant percentage. The bank was also highly deceptive ( violating XXXX ) in its similarly-named product with vastly different interest rates, and caused additional customer harm by acting against reasonable consumer belief by failing to raise interest rates on the older product.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TX,75048,,Consent provided,Web,02-01-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8264354.0

Despite using Zelle numerous times and reporting discrepancies, my financial institution and Zelle failed to investigate my claims adequately. They informed me that recovering lost funds was impossible and that tracking these transactions was unfeasible.

When the screen read, card must be removed prior to cash dispensed, I did not remove my card in time. The ATM printed a receipt saying incomplete transaction, contact your financial institution. The money came out of my account but no cash ever came from the machine. 

I filed a dispute with XXXX, they eventually gave me a provisional credit after XXXX weeks, then XXXX weeks later PNC denied my claim, stating the following this transaction was processed correctly. This transaction was valid, the money was dispensed, and based on the ATM audit tape, we have concluded our investigation. I had XXXX appeal their decision, and they denied the appeal the same day. I told XXXX to ask PNC if their ATM balanced during their next cash count. I also asked them to ask PNC to explain how I could receive that receipt if the transaction was processed correctly. XXXX has not advocated on my behalf and even though I am still communicating with them trying to get them to help me, they took my {$400.00} back out of my account. 

I filed a police report since they are the only ones who can get surveillance footage from the XXXX XXXX, but have not heard anything from them nor do I expect to. They are understaffed and overworked. It doesnt seem to me that PNC investigated anything at all.

01/15/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Subject : Request for Review of Chase Credit Card Account Closures and Inconsistent Handling To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally request your assistance in reviewing a matter involving JPMorgan Chase Bank and the closure of my credit card accounts. While I take responsibility for an error on my part, I believe Chases handling of my accountsparticularly the issuance and subsequent closure of a third accountraises concerns about their processes and fairness. 

Background I held XXXX credit card accounts with Chase : Account ending in XXXX : Opened on XX/XX/XXXX, and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Account ending in XXXX : Opened on XX/XX/XXXX, and closed on XX/XX/XXXX, alongside the first account. 
Third account : Opened and closed in XX/XX/XXXX, issued through Chases system as a pre-approved offer after the closure of my first XXXX accounts. 
The first XXXX accounts were in good standing, with no missed or late payments. Occasionally, I filed disputes through Chases app when dissatisfied with purchases, and these disputes were often resolved in my favor.

The Incident The issue began when I disputed a {$38.00} charge from an auto mechanic. The mechanic charged me for an incomplete service, and I believed the charge was unjustified. While attempting to dispute the charge via the Chase app, I mistakenly selected the option for an "" unauthorized transaction '' instead of accurately describing the issue. 

Following an investigation, Chase determined that this misuse, along with past disputes, violated their policies, leading to the closure of my first XXXX accounts. While I regret the error and accept responsibility, I am concerned about what happened next. 

Concerns About Chases Handling Issuance and Closure of the Third Account : After closing my first XXXX accounts, Chases system pre-approved me for a third credit card, which was automatically approved when I accepted the offer via their mobile app. I applied in good faith, believing this indicated a willingness to continue our relationship. However, Chase closed this account shortly after its issuance, citing the same reasons as the previous closures. This inconsistency is both confusing and frustrating. 

Lack of Transparency : While I understand Chases right to close accounts for policy violations, issuing and then closing the third account undermines the rationale for the initial closures. Additionally, Chase removed the details of this third account from my online banking profile, making it difficult for me to reference it. 

Impact on My Credit Report and Score : The closure of all three accounts has been reported as closed by grantor on my credit report. Despite my excellent payment history and a prior credit score of around XXXX, these closures reduced my score to XXXX. This has negatively affected my ability to obtain new credit, as recent applications to other issuers were denied.

Requested Resolution I respectfully request the following : A formal review of Chases decision to issue and then close the third account after terminating my first XXXX accounts. 
An explanation of Chases internal processes to ensure customers are not subjected to such inconsistent treatment. 
If possible, reconsideration of the decision to close my third account, as its issuance implied a willingness to maintain the relationship. 


I acknowledge the importance of adhering to policies and take responsibility for my mistake in filing the dispute. However, I believe Chases actions, particularly the issuance and closure of the third account, were inconsistent and have unnecessarily impacted my credit score and financial standing. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and hope for a fair resolution.

Despite my persistent efforts to rectify these errors in accordance with my rights as a consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), it is disheartening to note that these issues remain unresolved.

Over the course of the past several months, I have repeatedly exercised my right to dispute the inaccuracies on my credit report, citing the provisions of 15 U.S.C 1681 as a reminder of your legal obligation to ensure the fairness of the information you disseminate. My disputes on all 5 accounts listed below ( In Addition to, an address I have no knowledge of nor have I lived at the address ), each backed by solid evidence of inaccuracies, have been submitted through certified mail and meticulously documented to ensure a clear and traceable record of communication. 

Despite my adherence to the prescribed dispute process and the gravity of the matter, I have yet to witness any meaningful action taken by the companies listed to rectify these erroneous entries. It is disconcerting to realize that my diligent efforts to correct these inaccuracies, backed by the law, have been met with indifference. 

Furthermore, I have discovered that my personal information has been shared without my consent to various third-party entities for financial benefit, a practice that appears to contradict both the principles of privacy and the standards set forth by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The unauthorized sharing of my sensitive financial data raises serious concerns about my privacy and security, and it is essential that this practice is immediately ceased. 

I want to emphasize that my intent is not to engage in a confrontational exchange but rather to assert my rights and seek a resolution that upholds the principles of fairness, transparency, and accuracy that the credit reporting system is built upon. 

In light of the continued inaction and indifference to my plight, I am left with no choice but to escalate this matter. I expect an urgent and comprehensive response to this complaint, to rectify the inaccuracies on my credit report and ensure that my personal information is no longer shared without my explicit consent.

I told her this is my checking account not credit card therefore I need this money and I won't wait 30 days for dispute transaction. I told her this is fraud transaction and you are responsible to protect my money. She refused to take any action. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I saw a pending transaction XXXX $ on my checking account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called to PNC fraud department and told them about this un autorized transaction. I told them that I reported it 3 days ago and PNC did not stop this transaction. I demanded the immediate cancellation of this transaction but PNC employee refused. She told me to dispute transaction and wait 30 days for my money. I I replied that I will report it to the CFPB and XXXX Next day on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from PNC fraud department. their employee asked for details of this transaction and offered 30 days to dispute the transaction because she doesn't have any option to stop transaction.

I went to the bank and asked if they could give me a printout of anyone that was falsely added to my wells fargo bank account without my knowledge or consent and the bank manager told me know. It was a privacy issue. But to my knowledge I should of been given that since it was my bank account.

I was on the phone with agent ROZ102 for 37 minutes ( and before that, with a previous colleague who transferred me to this department ), to ask them about why they have restricted my account, just to learn that 1. they can not tell me why Capital One has randomly blocked my account 2. in order to verify me, and provide me any further information, they need to scan a government issued ID to proceed. 
As a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I do not have such card, and I do not have the legal ability to get one. I explained my situation and told them I can scan a Hungarian ID document ( XXXX is part of the XXXX ), and asked her if that would be acceptable, which she answered with a clear and loud yes. I carefully scanned the card multiple times, upon which she asked me "" What ID do you have? '' - I repeat my initial answer and she now tells me that my government issued ID is not valid for Capital One purposes. ( It is a completely valid ID. ) I proceed to ask what documents do they accept from the ones I opened my account with, since the only documents I have are : Hungarian driver 's license, XXXX  ID card, XXXX ID card, address card, XXXX  Passport with XXXX, XXXX card, and XXXX XXXX ID card. They then inform me none of these are accepted. I responded, by explaining that I opened an ACCOUNT with them using these documents, and US immigration law prohibits students on XXXX XXXX ( as well as all other nonresident aliens ) to acquire a U.S. govt. issued ID other than XXXX. The agent repeats : "" I need a govt. issued ID. "". Facing a complete lack of basic human intelligence, I ask "" then what should I do to re-gain access to my own account? '' - upon which I get the same robotic answer for the next 5-6 times. I tried to explain how absolutely ridiculous these demands sound, since it is completely impossible for me to present such card and she also told me that SSN and Passport will not be accepted. She even put me on hold to consult with a supervisor. Furthermore, I asked whether going in physically to a Capital One office would resolve the issue, upon which she responded that she "" can not advise me on that '' and also that "" in order to proceed, no matter where, we will ask you to present a government issued ID ''. 

I had the worst experience with Capital One and it will take a long time to restore my faith in the company after this terrible, awful, unmatched and miserable customer service experience. Never in my life have I faced such an incredibly shameful experience, and many other international people have to face the same issues according to online forums. It is completely discriminatory and also leaves many with the only option to close the account, since Capital One locks our money in the account. This would damage the users ' credit scores significantly, which is extremely important if someone imagines their long-term future in the United States and ready to work here or stay for future studies after college. 
I demand Capital One to explain this situation to me and many other victims of this scandal. Do not let people open accounts who will then not be able to access it. I would also like to ask the methods in which you plan to compensate me for facing such a discriminatory, shameful experience, and also losing much of my time and effort that I put in to try fixing these issues.

I canceled services with both Wix and Motive several months ago and contacted American Express to request that all related automatic payments be stopped. Despite my repeated requestssubmitted over five timesAmerican Express has failed to take appropriate action. As a result, I was billed for the following charges : XXXX : {$350.00} and {$180.00} Motive : Two charges of {$240.00} each I have since provided American Express with copies of emails that include the cancellation confirmations and corresponding dates. I have also communicated directly with both XXXX  and Motive, and representatives from both companies acknowledged the cancellations.

In addition to these unresolved disputes, American Express recently decreased my credit limit after I was a victim of identity theft, which caused a temporary drop in my credit score. Despite never having a late payment with American Express, they penalized me by lowering my limit, which I believe is both unfair and damaging to my financial standing. I respectfully request that my original credit limit be reinstated. 

I am seeking your assistance in holding American Express accountable for : Failing to honor dispute submissions and stop unauthorized autopayments Not properly investigating and resolving repeated billing complaints Reducing my credit limit despite a solid payment history and extenuating circumstances",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/29/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13788302.0

Concora Credit provided documentation of the transaction and it clearly says that each item purchased was picked up at the XXXX XXXX XXXX - They were not delivered to my house at all, as Concora Credit incorrectly claims. I called XXXX XXXX and I CONFIRMEND this is the case. 

Additionally the email and phone number provided by the perpetrator, are not mine. The signature is also not mine. Also, it's stated on the invoice that an Arizona ID was used. I do not have an Arizona ID card, only an Arizona Drivers license. 

This person had my personal information, which was leaked in a data breach by a major healthcare company. They likely had my name, social security number, address, email address, and phone number. I don't understand how sending billing statements to my house AFTER the card was opened and nearly maxed out is being used as evidence against me.

They said that I needed to have a debit card in order to be verified. I don't have a debit card, I provided my social security # and credit card #.

I have no idea why they would allow people to open CD accounts, knowing that they can not transfer funds in the mobile app and if you call in you need a debit card in order be verified or have a passcode that can not be set up with CD.

I will give the back details so that all of this makes sense. I had checked my bank account the morning of XX/XX/XXXX to see that my bank account had been overdrawn by {$120.00} exactly. This overdraft was suppose to be coming from my health insurance on top of their ( {$110.00} ) they also took another ( {$34.00} ) for the overdraft since the money wasn't all in the account. I didn't pay it any mind and was just going to get myself back in a positive when I got paid that Friday. I continued think about how greedy it was of them to take their money and still yet charge me the {$34.00} overdraft fee on top of what they were already receiving from me. I decided to call XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX on that Monday to ask why they still charge me the overdraft fee after getting their money that was owed to them. It was to my surprise that they told me, "" We aren't sure who that money is going to, but your premium to us is $ XXXX a month. '' The woman and I talked about these transactions and what were named on my bank statement. She even said they she didn't have any record of me paying anything to them. She contacted the business that it said on the statements and we completed a three-way call. The other lady for the business "" XXXX XXXX '' also stated that she couldn't even find an account for me or find anything that says that I had ever paid anything to them. She even expressed that their business is life insurance and not medical insurance. After completing the call with both women, I was advised to get in touch with my bank to dispute these transactions. I spoke to a gentleman through the customer service line at Chase who helped me dispute these charges that went all the way into XXXX of XXXX. He had said that he had never saw things like this personally but had heard about it. I provided a document straight from the insurance company that states that my premium is $ XXXX a month. If I had not been curious of their greed then I would have never found out that all of these charges were fraudulent. It was of course to my surprise when I had check my account today, XX/XX/XXXX, to see that the dispute was being reversed and had drawn my checking account to XXXX. I filed these claims almost two months ago and now they are reversing them, leaving me in a financially hard place.

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the permanent limitation placed on my PayPal account with the email address XXXX. I believe there has been a mistake in this decision, and I would like to appeal for a re-evaluation of my case. 

First and foremost, I want to emphasize that I have always strived to adhere to PayPal 's policies and guidelines. I have not knowingly violated any of these policies, and I take the terms of service seriously. Therefore, I am perplexed by the decision to permanently limit my account. 

I kindly request that PayPal conducts a thorough and impartial review of my account activity. I am confident that upon such a review, you will find no substantial grounds to justify the permanent limitation. I am more than willing to provide any additional information or documentation required to assist in this re-evaluation process. 

My PayPal account has been an essential tool for managing my financial transactions and online payments. Its limitation has caused significant inconvenience and disruption to my personal and business activities. I sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved promptly so that I can regain access to my account and continue using PayPal 's services. 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that my account limitation was imposed in error and request that PayPal re-investigate my case thoroughly. I kindly ask for the restoration of my account if, upon review, it is found that there are no valid grounds for its permanent limitation. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I eagerly await a favorable resolution to this issue.

I have encountered multiple instances of apparent violations that have negatively impacted my credit report and financial well-being. Through this letter, I hope to provide you with a detailed account of the violations I have experienced and to share a personal story of how these issues have profoundly affected my life. 

XXXX XXXX # XXXX - Late Payment** I have recently discovered a late payment entry on my credit report from XXXX XXXX, account number XXXX. This late payment entry has caused significant distress for me, as I have always been diligent in maintaining a timely payment history. This violation, which I believe is in contravention of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), has affected my ability to secure favorable terms on credit, leading to increased financial strain. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX # XX/XX/XXXX - Inquiries Inquiries by XXXX XXXX XXXX on my credit report, dated XX/XX/XXXX, are particularly troubling. These inquiries were made without my explicit consent and without any legitimate reason. I am of the understanding that such actions are in violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), which outlines the permissible purposes of consumer reports. The unauthorized inquiries have contributed to an unnecessary decrease in my credit score, causing additional hardship for me. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX # XX/XX/XXXX - Inquiries Similarly, inquiries made by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX have further compounded the negative impact on my credit score and financial well-being. These inquiries appear to be in breach of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), undermining the accuracy and fairness of my credit report. 

XXXX OF XXXX # XX/XX/XXXX - Inquiries The inquiries by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX have had similar adverse effects on my credit profile. These actions seem to disregard the provisions of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), which exist to protect consumers from unwarranted and unauthorized inquiries that can significantly harm their creditworthiness. 

Address Discrepancies- XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX | XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX | XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX I have observed multiple instances of address discrepancies in my credit report. The addresses listed, including XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX, are inaccurate and not associated with me. I believe these discrepancies are a breach of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Section 807 ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ), which prohibits false or misleading representations. These inaccuracies have further contributed to the inaccuracies in my credit report, impeding my access to essential financial resources. 

Personal Story : Allow me to share a personal story that underscores the profound impact these violations have had on my life. As a single parent working tirelessly to provide for my family, maintaining a strong credit profile is crucial for securing stable housing, favorable interest rates, and the overall financial stability that my loved ones deserve. The stress and anxiety caused by these violations have taken an emotional toll on my well-being. My efforts to create a secure future for my family are being jeopardized by factors beyond my control, leaving me in a state of constant worry. 

In light of the above, I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's intervention to rectify these violations and enforce my legal rights as a consumer. I urge you to ensure that the creditors promptly remove the unverified accounts from my credit report, as well as any associated negative impacts on my XXXX XXXX. Your assistance in resolving these matters will greatly alleviate the distress I have been enduring and provide me with the opportunity to rebuild my financial stability. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a timely resolution. Please find enclosed copies of relevant documentation supporting my claims. 

Thank you for your consideration.

06/17/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Formal Complaint Regarding Billing Cycle Error and Improper Interest Charges by Wells Fargo Credit Card Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . regarding a billing cycle error on my credit card account that has resulted in improper interest charges and a negative account status, despite my consistent on-time payments. 

Background : I have used my Wells Fargo credit card for the past year, primarily to pay my monthly rent. Each month, I charge my rent and pay the balance in full and on time. I have never missed a payment or carried a revolving balance. 

In XX/XX/year>, a billing cycle error occurred : My XXXX rent was charged on XX/XX/year> My XXXX rent was charged on XX/XX/year> The statement closing date was XX/XX/year> Because both rent charges fell within the same billing cycle, the statement reflected a total balance of XXXX  XXXX my typical monthly amount of approximately {$4200.00}. 

I made my standard monthly payment of {$4200.00}. Despite this, Wells Fargo marked my account as past due and began assessing interest on the remaining balance. While a {$92.00} interest charge was initially waived as a goodwill gesture, I was told interest would continue to accrue unless I paid the entire doubled balancean unfair expectation based solely on how the dates fell in the billing cycle.

My Attempts to Resolve the Issue : I contacted Wells Fargo multiple times to explain the situation and request a correction. Representatives acknowledged the nature of the error but indicated there was no way to adjust the account due to system limitations. I was advised to pay in full to avoid further interest, despite the fact that the overlapping charges were caused by the calendar, not by any action or inaction on my part.

Why This Is Unfair : Wells Fargos refusal to correct this issue penalizes responsible cardholders and effectively charges interest on a non-delinquent account. Their system is inflexible in a way that harms consumers who follow the rules.

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to compel Wells Fargo to : Reverse all interest charges resulting from this billing cycle overlap Adjust the account balance and history to reflect my consistent on-time payments and eliminate the past due designation Review its billing cycle practices to ensure that overlapping charges do not unfairly penalize consumers This situation has caused me financial harm, significant time loss, and emotional distress. It is unacceptable that a consumer should be penalized for making on-time payments simply due to how dates fall on the calendar. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,10010,,Consent provided,Web,06/17/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,14131570.0

On XXXX XXXX XXXX a client of mine did an in branch transfer for an order to be fulfilled. A couple days had gone by and on XXXX XXXX XXXX I had gotten notification that my account had been restricted. That day I called chase and they said they needed to verify I owned the business and for me to bring in a phone bill that has my name and my company name on it. 

I went into the branch with the verification they requested and thats when they changed their story. They stated that my name needed to be listed on the Secretary of State website. I called the Secretary of State in XXXX  and they said that was not possible as they dont list owners on the website only registered agents and I cant be a registered agent unless I live in XXXX  which I live in XXXX. I informed chase about this and they said that was the only way they would release my money. 

After failing to gain any traction with chase I spoke with my clients and they said they have a contact. My client said his contact was an executive vp in compliance for chase. When my client spoke to them the contact stated that I must be lying and that he would not look into the matter. He stated that it was absolutely not a chase policy that I had to be on the SoS website and quoted XXXX  law. 

Since then Ive been trying to resolve this but to no avail. Every banker I speak to is just as baffled about the situation. Ive even had security supervisors at chase put in a request to release the funds because it must be a mistake and its been denied.They refuse to release my funds from my account with no legal reason supporting their actions. Ive confirmed this because Ive spoken to their legal department and they have no belief or accusations of any wrong doing for my account. 

Its now been over a month and theyre still refusing to release my money. My name is XXXX XXXX and my company name is XXXX XXXX out of XXXX.

I took advantage of 0 % interest by applying for a credit card with GreenSky. During the following 24 months XXXX provided poor workmanship and caused substantial damage to our home. We had three major leaks from the new patio door and because of poor workmanship and incorrect advice from XXXX, it was installed and reinstalled four times. As a result, we no longer have the brand-new door XXXX agreed to provide us with. As a result of the leaks and substantial delays from XXXX, we suffered major damage and financial harm. We were unable to use our master bedroom for nine consecutive months, whilst mold testing and redecorating were carried out. At great inconvenience, we moved into our guest bedroom. During that period our daughter was unable to visit us, business colleagues were unable to stayover, and my brother, recently bereft of his fiance, had to stay in a hotel for his entire stay. 
We told GreenSky we were in dispute with the merchant several times and also told them not to post any charges to our account until the dispute was resolved. However, GreenSky ignored our complaints and paid XXXX the final payment for the door and charged our credit card. This took away any leverage we had with XXXX to complete the work and bring our home back to a livable standard in a timely manner. 
GreenSky sent an email to me on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ) saying that they had conducted an investigation. The rest of the email made no sense to me whatsoever. I responded to this email on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ) asking for clarification and also an explanation of the 10 % credit that appeared on my account. I also requested that all further communication be via email.

Within 5 minutes a person or persons started on a day long spending spree that spent over {$15000.00}. My card never left my hand. At XXXX the next day I was contacted by Wells Fargo security about some very large transactions being made out of my state. I was on the phone for 45 minutes and the agent said he had turned off my card and a new one would be sent. This was after the card had already been used for many transactions that the fraud department wasn't aware of. He did not turn off the card. Tuesday, I look at my account and find that a person having nothing more than the information on my card talked Wells Fargo bank by telephone into moving almost {$17000.00} from my checking account to my credit card so they could spend more money? This all stopped because Wells was so slow in posting it that the card was overdrawn, and they gave up. 
I went to my bank branch and my banker made a claim for the {$17000.00} and it was moved back from the credit card to my checking account. Done well. I made a detailed study of my credit card charges and paid each item that was mine. One day before I had a XXXX balance, so it was about XXXX items.

The rule underscores the need for transparency, accountability, and timely resolution of disputes in the remittance process. Unfortunately, my experience with BOSS Revolution illustrates a failure to meet these standards. 

Background : On XX/XX/year>, I used BOSS Revolution to transfer {$2000.00} to my recipients GTBank account in XXXX. BOSS Revolution claims the funds were successfully credited to XXXX on XX/XX/year>. However, my recipient has provided official bank statements confirming that the funds have not been credited to their account. 

I previously filed a complaint with the CFPB ( Complaint # XXXX ), which was closed without resolution. Despite my rebuttal, BOSS Revolution has failed to take meaningful action to resolve the issue.

Failure to Comply with the CFPBs New Rule : The CFPBs recent regulation of money transfer services emphasizes the responsibility of providers like BOSS Revolution to ensure that funds reach the intended recipient and to provide timely, transparent resolutions when issues arise. BOSS Revolution has failed to comply in the following ways : 1. Failure to Ensure Funds Are Credited : While BOSS Revolution claims the funds were transferred, the recipient has not received the money. This contradicts the goal of protecting consumers by ensuring successful delivery of funds.

2. Inadequate Transparency and Support : BOSS Revolution has failed to provide clear proof that the funds are accessible to the recipient. They have also shifted the burden of resolving this issue onto me and the recipient, rather than engaging directly with XXXX to resolve the discrepancy.

3. Dismissive Compensation : In response to my prior complaint, BOSS Revolution offered a promotional code for a free transaction.

The reason behind this issue I believe : My XXXX  credit card had autopay turned on and never turned off. On XX/XX/year>, I got a notification that there was a past-due payment on my account, and my credit scores from all three major bureaus dropped immediately. I called XXXX right away and asked about the issue and they said there was a {$6.00} past-due balance. This was very strange as I never turned off auto-pay. It was later I found out through XXXX and later confirmed by a representative of XXXX, that XXXX XXXX XXXX ' autopay gets automatically XXXX after XXXX  months of no use of the card. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! and the representative agreed that this is not my fault and therefore dispute it and remove the record off my account. The next day, XXXX and XXXX took it off my record and my credit scores were recovered. I was still waiting on TransUnion. XXXX, XXXX rolled back on that decision and dropped my score again with the record back on their file. However, the only record they had was that there was a late-payment and the late-payment amount was {$0.00}. The account status was "" in good standing ''. When I called the XXXX line they said XXXX did not provide them with enough paperwork to reverse the record, which was very weird considering Experian was fixed and never rolled back. So I have a record on late payment of {$0.00} that is affecting my credit score with no reasonable person to talk with on XXXX or transunion other than the offer to just file yet another dispute, which I know will be ruled against, despite the obvious fact that the late amount due is {$0.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MI,48104,,Consent provided,Web,04/14/24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8767153.0

I requested the cost be removed, but my request was denied. I seek resolution for this issue The story goes like this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, my credit card went missing, and on XX/XX/XXXX, someone began using it fraudulently. Unfortunately, I was unaware of the loss until XX/XX/XXXX when my bank detected suspicious activity on my account. 
I typically do not use this Bank of America card for regular purchases. It is for XXXX charging and minor expenses via XXXX XXXX, which is why I did not notice the unauthorized charges sooner. Because of this limited use, the fraudulent transactions went undetected for five days. 
After receiving a notification from my bank, I immediately suspended the card. Upon reviewing my statement, I discovered that a total of {$1000.00} had been spent across six unauthorized transactions between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. 
Even one of these transactions was made at a gas station in XXXX XXXX, a place I have not visited. ( Refer to the history for the fraud transactions below ) On XX/XX/XXXX, {$210.00} at XXXX in XXXXXXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, {$250.00} at a pet shop in XXXXXXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, {$210.00} at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, {$230.00} at XXXX XXXX in XXXXXXXX XXXX  On XX/XX/XXXX, {$47.00} at XXXX XXXX station in XXXXXXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, {$100.00} at XXXX XXXX station in XXXX XXXX. 

Out of the expenses listed above, only the XXXX charge of {$210.00} was recognized as fraudulent and removed. I do not understand why only this particular charge was addressed.The bank deducted the remaining {$850.00} from my account. 

When I first reported the issue to the bank ( Claim Number : XXXX ), I was told it couldn't be approved because I had already received the product or service. After filing a police report ( Report number : XXXX, attached ) and resubmitting my claim, I was rejected twice more for the same reason. I also provided proof from my company HR that I did not leave work on the day of the fraudulent transaction. I need to understand why my claim was rejected and request a clear explanation.

04-09-2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"American Express Company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  RE : Denial of Equity ; Demand for Consideration To whom it shall concern, On or around XX/XX/XXXX I tendered a security, ( Ref : XXXX ) in acceptance to the offer your company proposed in your prospectus, for fair exchange of American Express Company products. I received a response in the mail stating that my application was denied because of a poor XXXX score, however, according to your prospectus dated XX/XX/XXXX, filed pursuant to Rule 424 ( b ) ( 5 ) with the SEC, in the annex section of that document, on pg. XXXX, the first sentence of the passage states, XXXX  scores are based on independent, third-party information, the accuracy of which we can not verify. The question then arises what other factors were used in denying me when I tendered a security that your company will turn into a receivable that you are going to receive payment for. It is unfair and deceptive to rely on information that you can not verify to determine my eligibility for American Express products, this could be construed as violations of UDAAP under federal law. 
To my knowledge XXXX scores are used to determine the potential risks of prospective consumers, I have read and understood the concerns outlined in you guys prospectus in regards to risk and you can rest assured that my account will never be delinquent, there will never be a period of inactivity or dormancy with my charges and my account will be paid on time each and every month because I will be satisfying my obligation by tendering payment with the series of notes that American Express will issue out on the distribution date which is the XXXX  of every month as described in your Prospectus. 
Furthermore, the taking of my application, with my personal identifiable information on its face, i.e. the social security number, and the transferring thereof to a depositor where it was pooled together with other receivables ( eligible investment ) and sold/transferred to a securitization special purpose entity ( trust ) for proceeds which is considered unjust enrichment and securities fraud on your companys behalf because I received no benefit. In addition, because you accepted my security you were supposed to be acting as POA in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit and protection of the investor. Fair exchange has never been robbery, quid pro quo, this was a barter transaction that took place with your company for equal value and consideration neither of which were received by me. Your company is in violation of the securities laws you agreed to follow and if I have to contact the I.R.S to inform them that I bartered to you a security and you decided not to live up to your end of the bargain by bartering back with me, I will have no choice but to notify them, which could have a damaging effect on the American Express Brand if further action is necessary.

Let it be known and allow me to reiterate that the American Express Company owes me valuable consideration ( in the form of an American Express open-end Platinum credit card or its equivalent ) for the exchange of my security, which constituted a bartering transaction, that of which will be filed on a 1099B with the I.R.S if you continue to refuse to barter with me. Ill let the I.R.S handle it. There may have been some sort of misunderstanding with the terms of the contract, but let me reassure you that I intend for this arrangement to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved, including myself. However, as it stands right now, I have been held without equity and American Express Company is in violation of its bank charter, federal securities laws, and their agreements on file with the SEC because pursuant to your prospectus you told the SEC you would not trade securities on the secondary market, or maybe Im misinterpreting what was stated. Anyway, you may have many concerns none of which shall arise from doing business with me and many of which would result from your failure to compensate me for my investment into your company as a silent investor.

IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DECIDE NOT TO COMPLY I WILL BE FORCED TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE OCC, THE SEC, THE CFPB AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, SEPARATELY FOR YOUR WILLFUL NONCOMPLIANCE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT. YOU HAVE XXXX ( XXXX ) DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE TO RESPOND WITH A DECISION REGARDING THIS MATTER. 
Please tell me what are the factors that the underwriting team used to decide the application reasoning for denial. I gave you my social security number which gave you access to my trust. Several laws have been violated, such as 15 us code 1666b and the violation of the security exchange act of 1934.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,PA,190XX,,Consent provided,Web,04-09-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8731098.0

Every month, I make my payment on time and in excess of the minimum payment due. The excess amount of the minimum due does not get applied to the promotional balance, as setup by myself online and via customer service - multiple times. Because I work for a financial institution, Im very familiar with the CFPB regulations for proper payment allocations. Each month, I have to call in to get the payment adjusted correctly/payment allocation setup again and Citibank keeps telling me theyve fixed it. The agents do not complete the request. I am concerned with consumers that are relying on the system processing payments correctly, as they are probably being charged inadvertently with all deferred interest as they think payments are applied correctly. And when you call, the agents say they take care of the issue but never do. Ive taken all the proper steps but their system still doesnt work correctly. This is deceptive behavior!!

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX that XXXX XXXX XXXX was added as a contact to my Zelle account and to contact them If there was an issue. I have never used Zelle in the past and contacted XXXX immediately. The Zelle account is housed under my phone number and email. While on the phone I noticed another email from XXXX timed one minute after the first one received that a XXXX had been sent to this individual. I disputed this transaction and removed information for Zelle access and ordered new debit cards. While on the phone I received texts from XXXX where someone was also attempting to use our debit card numbers. These charges were flagged as suspicious by XXXX and declined. Once I arrived home I went to talk to my husband and found him on the phone with XXXX also disputing the XXXX withdrawal. We pieced it together and he had called a phone number for assistance with a small disputed transaction. This number and the charge were fraudulent. My husband is XXXX XXXX XXXX and when on the phone with the perpetrator he somehow allowed a screen share for assistance and Im not exactly sure what else happened but my spouse is a victim. Hes not sure how he allowed this person access to our accounts and debit card. While on the phone with the person the Zelle transfer immediately came out. My husband then realized he was a victim of fraud. He doesnt remember exactly what he did or didnt do. He is XXXX and on multiple medications and suffers from short term memory loss. He did tell me that the person he was talking to confused him and had him doing all sorts of things on the computer. I told the second XXXX rep this on the phone. I was told that this XXXX would be reported to the crime dept of XXXX and that someone would be in contact with us. No one called at all to discuss this. I called for an update today and was told that XXXX had ruled against us and that the dispute would not be reopened or appealed and was closed. They would not tell me why they determined this outcome other than we would receive a letter in the mail. Here are my concerns. 1. This was obviously cyber crime and elderly crime. Whether its legally considered fraud or a scam doesnt matter. My husband was targeted and victimized. 2. My account was not protected. From the time I was notified that a contact was added to the Zelle account to the withdrawal the lapsed time was one minute. Protections were not put in place. This transfer should have been flagged because the account had never had a Zelle transaction before and the amount of XXXX is excessive for this account leaving under XXXX in it. If there had been a hold placed on the withdrawal until XXXX had my consent that it was legitimate this would have been avoided. XXXX flagged the debit card transactions and declined them yet no such protections are in place for Zelle payments? I request the funds to be replaced. I did submit a fraud report to the FBI with the recipients name. 
Update XX/XX/XXXX XXXX contacted me today regarding this complaint. Per the representative because my husband authorized the transaction we are not entitled to any refund. I explained ( again ) how he was unaware of what the fraudulent person was asking him to do and that it was a mixture of screen sharing and coercion. He also had no clue what Zelle is. I cited his age and issues. I also explained ( again ) that as a first time Zelle transfer I should have been given adequate notice to stop the transaction. I should have been given more than one minute between the email that stated a name was added to Zelle and the issuance of payment. If flags were in place as they are for debit card transactions this could have been avoided. I also referenced an article that stated there would be security features in place for first time Zelle payments ( see pic ). I also stated that from my research Zelle has refunded fraud and scams on a case by case basis. I request that Zelle also be brought into the loop regarding this transaction. Also from my research it is possible to recover the funds from the recipient ( if fraud ). I again stated that their decision regarding this dispute is unsatisfactory. The agent I spoke with used the term fraud multiple times during our conversation which signifies that whether unknowingly authorized or unauthorized the transaction was the result of fraud. Please see the excerpt of the article attached concerning risky Zelle transfers. Where was the tool that would flag a risky transfer in this situation? Per the article the tool would have been implemented as a first time Zelle transfer and should have flagged it as risky. I have also attached the emails with the one minute lapse from the addition of a recipient to the withdrawal sent which illustrates that the tool / procedure that should have been in place per Zelle for a first time transaction was not. I again respectfully request reimbursement.",,"Early Warning Services, LLC",TN,380XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/29/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8439814.0

06/24/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Very early this morning my husband stopped at the ATM at our local branch of US Bank in XXXX Oregon to get some cash as he does every Monday morning. He was not able to get cash, he said the machine didn't even offer that as an option. 

About XXXX am he found the time to call me from work to let me know he could not access our account so that I could find out if there was a problem with our account or if there was a problem with the ATM. 

I spent the next few hours calling the branch to find out and no one answered the phone there. Eventually, someone answered the phone. When I inquired as to why they didn't answer the phone, I was told they were busy with customers in the branch. To which I replied that I am also a customer! I have been in that branch several times and there are ALWAYS more employees in there than customers. 

In fact, more times than not, there are no customers in the branch at all. More and more people are banking online or through ATMs. So, it should be no problem for the branch to answer their XXXX phones. 

This first person I spoke to hung up on me before I could find out if or when the ATM would have funds available. So, I called the 1-800 national number. The person I spoke to also tried calling the branch and no one answered. She kindly offered to send an email to someone at the branch asking them to call me. 

I did receive a phone call from someone who I believe was in management, but can't confirm that as I don't recall his name. He also hung up on me. 

I kept calling because I knew my husband would not be able to make it to the bank before they closed as he works long hours this time of year. So, if there was still no money in the ATM he would have to find another way to get some cash. 

I believe I probably dialed the phone number to the local branch close to 100 times today and only 3 times did someone answer. The third time XXXX answered and he informed me that he was in fact the Branch Manager. XXXX told me that there is a third party that takes care of managing the ATM machines. I asked when there would be funds available in the machines and he couldn't answer that. 

I asked XXXX for the phone number for this third party so I could find out when they would be servicing the machines and he wouldn't give me that information. So, I asked him to call them to find out. I also asked him to call me when he could answer that and not surprisingly, he knew my name and phone number. 

I bring up that XXXX could identify me because I suspect that either they had blocked my number or the other employees recognized my name and number and were choosing not to answer my calls later in the day after I had been hung up on twice. 

I talked to XXXX at about XXXX pm and expected to get a call back from him within XXXX minutes as I didn't believe it should take long for him to get answers from this third party. 

At XXXX pm I began calling the branch again. Knowing that I would need to let my husband know if he needed to stop someplace else to get his cash. No surprise, they never answered the phone. This is when I began to suspect my phone number had been blocked or was being ignored. 

So, I called the 1-800 number again. This person also tried to call the branch and got no answer. I would think that would be one call the branch should be require to answer. I asked her to send an email to XXXX and she replied she couldn't do that. Since I knew that someone else had done so, I asked to speak to her supervisor. While I was on hold waiting for the supervisor, my other line was ringing and I could see it was my local branch, so I hung up and took the call. 

It was now XXXX pm and this call was indeed XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX informed me that there was now money in the ATMs and that one of them was having mechanical issues and not working. I asked XXXX if they had blocked my phone number and he said no. So, they continued to ignore customers on the phone pretty much all day long. 

Look, I get that because fewer people are banking in person these days, staffing in financial institutions is inadequate, but this was ridiculous. In what business is it okay to simply ignore their customers trying to get answers or doing business on the phone? 

The few times I have been in the branch there have been at least 4-6 employees and anywhere from 0-3 customers. So, I really don't understand why no one answers the phones. I am XXXX and rarely go out of the house. I only go into the bank or any other brick-and-mortar business if necessary. I do curbside pick-up for groceries, online purchases to be shipped to me, and online banking as well. 

If they are not going to answer the phones, they need to provide a way for their customers to get answers. And that does not mean their 1-800 number for customer service. I think we all know that most "" customer service '' doesn't actually provide real customer service. Yes, they also have websites where you can get some questions answered. Whether or not there is money in the ATM is not one of them. 

It took me XXXX hours of persistent phone calls to find that out today. That is RIDICULOUS!

08/28/24,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"I have requested process and timing information for the trust of my grandparents of which I am one of the beneficiaries. We were initially made to wait 2 weeks after her passing for any information to arrive by mail. We were told that no information could be given over the phone or in person and that we had to await the letter. Once we received the letter we were made to wait an additional 2 weeks before we could access the house because our wealth manager and her supervisor were both out on vacation and there was no other person to help us until they returned. Less than a week before my grandmothers passing she, again, as many times before, told me of a folder that contained all of the information for when "" the time '' came. The time came and I drove 2 hours to retrieve the packet, only to arrive to the door locks changed and the garage door unplugged so the code and opener I had would not work. I could not get anyone immediately on the phone so made the 2 hour drive home. Once I did talk to someone I was told that they had already gone through that desk drawer and there was no such folder. She was of very sound mind until her last days and I don't believe she lied for years about the folder. Why does Arvest and their vendors have unsupervised access to the house from the day she died, but the family is not allowed? I believe we should be able to have a family representative present when anyone enters, or at least be notified. There are things missing, family heirlooms, that we believe were in the house and Arvest and their "" preferred '' vendors have been the only ones with unfettered access without family representation. Once we were granted time to go through the house we were initially told we would have 2 days. Before noon on the first day one of the managers told us that today would be the only day and that she was cancelling the next day because someone wasn't "" acting right ''. For her to have that much power over our family matriarch 's possessions and property, when I had let myself in through the garage and sat with my grandmother in that kitchen less than a month before, was devastating. Panic set in before noon and then I learned at XXXX that XXXX was the cut off. 6 hours to go though our grandparents almost 100 years of accumulation, with no thought of being able to ever go back, was heartbreaking for days. She did eventually make contact and grant another day, but multiple trips from 2 hours away could have been avoided had we had a bit more information about how it was going to go beforehand. There is an information vacuum I do not believe my grandparents would have agreed with based on the bullet points on the website that likely sold them on this service. It was less than 1 month before my grandfathers passing and he was onXX/XX/XXXX and heavily medicated when they entered this arrangement. They likely thought that this would be easier on the family, but I also believe they thought we would be informed along the way. I have had to reach out for any information, and in doing so only get the most basic. Timing and process are listed front and center on their list of services provided in the wealth management arena, but they have not produced any information on how they perform the processes nor how long they expect them to take in spite of multiple requests, only that they use "" preferred '' vendors. I was able to close out my mothers estate back in XX/XX/XXXXin just under 4 months and I knew nothing of the "" process ''. From finalizing credit cards to vehicle and house sale to disbursement of funds to beneficiaries all researched and completed in a timely manner with the peace of mind that is was done with the least expense necessary and the way she wanted. The trust manager told me that being executor and trustee is not an honor, but it does go a long way, in my opinion, towards knowing that your loved ones wishes are being properly and respectfully finalized and that funds intended for beneficiaries is not wasted on unnecessary expenses or funneled away to fees. The 2 times we have been to the house it appears as the HVAC is being kept at a temperature as if someone was actively living there, which we believe is a waste of funds. Arvest insisted on using their "" preferred '' lawn crew and the property is tended to more than we feel necessary, which we also feel is a waste of funds. Arvest has retained a large sum of cash from the estate for "" expenses '', but have not detailed what those might be. There are fees and disbursements listed on the only 1 statement I have received that are not explained in a way we can understand them and they are quite a large sum for only being half way through the year. Their "" preferred '' estate sale company has been busy with others and has not started sorting our grandparent 's estate for sale. It has been almost 2 months since we finished the family tours of the house and signed the paperwork that states we are done and wish for Arvest to proceed with the sale of the contents then the house. We feel another company should be chosen in the interest of time and reduction of continued cost to the estate for an undetermined amount of time while waiting on "" preferred '' vendors. I was informed on my last email reach out that there was an appraisal done, but the details remain unexplained. There was question about a vehicle and what we wanted done with it. We suggested it go to a family member, who now, just recently, is a single mother of XX/XX/XXXX due to a death so this is now more important to us, but we have not heard anything about the vehicle and it has been almost 2 months since we made the request.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"ARVEST BANK GROUP, INC.",OK,743XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/28/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9950983.0

Throughout my time with Chase, I have filed a handful of disputes. Unfortunately, in every instance, Chase has immediately sided with the merchant, disregarding the evidence and documentation I provided. 

Incident XXXX : XXXX XXXX in Hawaii Recently, I encountered a significant issue with a XXXX hotel in Hawaii. The hotel charged my account over XXXX times with different amounts, causing my account to go into overdraft due to multiple reversals and recharges. This resulted in me being charged more than the agreed amount. Despite providing Chase with all the necessary documentation, including confirmation from the hotel acknowledging their errors, Chase still sided with the hotel. 
I also will attach the invoice from the hotel clearly showing they overcharged me and the amount listed should add up to XXXX $ less than what they charged. 

When I called Chase to follow up, the representative informed me that Chase does not cover hotel disputes which is false after reading the policy, it clearly states overcharge or dissatisfaction of the service of hotels is covered. I voiced my concern and the representative shockingly responded, "" then walk into a branch and close your account. '' I filed a formal complaint regarding this unprofessional behavior, but I never received a response from Chase. 

Incident XXXX : XXXX  XXXX XXXX More recently, a XXXX  institute charged my account XXXX times with an amount I had not agreed to. Chase concluded that I was right and returned the amounts charged. After XXXX  months chase sent me a letter after the dispute resolution stating theyll take the amount back out because they came to change their minds. Despite providing proof of the incorrect charges, Chase still withdrew the disputed amount from my account. This is incredibly frustrating, especially after reading Chase 's policies which clearly state they should cover such disputes. It is evident that the representative lied to me, and I have no safety or protection when merchants fraudulently charge my account. 

**Overdraft Fees** Additionally, Chase has charged me hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees, sometimes charging me over XXXX times in XXXX day, which amounts to {$34.00} each time. These excessive fees have made it difficult for me to bring my account current, further exacerbating my financial situation. 

I am extremely disappointed with Chase 's dispute resolution process and the lack of professionalism and support from their representatives. It appears that Chase prioritizes merchants over their loyal customers, leaving us vulnerable to fraudulent charges. 

I seek your assistance in addressing these unfair practices and ensuring that Chase implements a fair and transparent dispute resolution process. I am also requesting that Chase reviews and addresses my disputes and the behavior of their representatives appropriately.

XXXX, NC XXXX CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU / CASE NUMBER XXXX RESPONSE OF XXXX XXXX XXXX | XXXX XXXX TO BANK OF AMERICAS RESPONSE DATED XX/XX/XXXX : In your response to my claim ( case # XXXX ), it is said : In accordance to our Deposit Agreement and Disclosures, ( the : Agreement ) which comprises part of the contract between us and our clients, we may reject payments orders. We ( BoA ) are not liable to you for the rejection. 

It is also said in your response of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  : On XX/XX/XXXX, a wire transfer sent by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, in the amount of {$30000.00} posted to your account ending in XXXX. As noted in our Agreement there may be times when the beneficiarys bank may make payment to the beneficiary based solely on the account or other identifying number, even if the name on the payment order differs from the name on the account and we accept. In this instance, this wire was repaired and credited to your account, but that is not a bank standard. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America rejected a wire transfer similar on all points to the one sent on XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of America by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on behalf of XXXX XXXX, account ending in XXXX. 

As justification for the rejection of the wire transfer of XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America invoked that when the account ending in XXXX was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, it was titled XXXX XXXX XXXX, In Trust For ( ITF ) XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

Another justification for the rejection of the wire transfer of XX/XX/XXXX, invoked by Bank of America is that : there may be times when Bank of America may decide ( depending of its mood? ) to accept or reject a wire transfer, implying that Bank of America has the unilateral right or authority to modify the terms and conditions of the contract between the bank and its customers. 

A contract is considered bilateral when two parties express their willingness to adhere to the agreement. These two parties commit to each other and modify their legal situation accordingly. 

On the other hand, a contract is qualified as unilateral when an agreement of wills binds only one of the parties. In this case, only one person commits, while the other party has no obligation. A common example of a one-sided contract is an offer of a reward for finding a lost item. 

In short, bilaterality is essential for an agreement to be considered a contract. It reflects the mutual exchange of obligations between the parties, thereby ensuring the validity and effectiveness of the agreement. 

It is important to note that unilateral will can also play a role in the formation of a contract, although the initial preparation is often the work of a single person before both parties formally commit. 

Bank of America issued several booklets of checks under the name of XXXX XXXX who, until today still detains three ( 3 ) booklets of checks under the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX to XXXX ; XXXX to XXXX ; XXXX to XXXX ) - and no more booklets of checks under the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX - violated its own Deposit Agreement and Disclosures ( the Agreement ) which comprises part of the contract between BoA and its clients, mislead XXXX XXXX XXXX who, especially after the acceptance of the wire transfer of XX/XX/XXXX by Bank of America, could rightfully believe that the name XXXX XXXX written by Bank of America on its checks is legitimately acceptable and usable to carry out wire transfers like any other banking transactions. 

Bank of America could and should have, after repairing and crediting the transfer of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  to my bank account ending in XXXX - based on the principles of contractual bilaterality and reciprocity, essential to guarantee fairness and trust in contractual relations- inform and warn XXXX XXXX not to use XXXX XXXX for future transfers. 

Based on the above considerations, Bank of America by falling to inform and warn XXXX XXXX XXXX not to use XXXX XXXX for future transfers after issuing booklets of checks under the name of XXXX XXXX and repairing and crediting the transfer of XX/XX/XXXX, acted in bad faith, violated, once again, the contract between the parties and caused harm to XXXX XXXX XXXX | XXXX XXXX at the eve of the XXXX holidays. 

Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX | XXXX XXXX reserves the right to take such legal actions as necessary against Bank of America to obtain, right and reasonable compensation for the harm unduly caused by Bank of America, if a reasonable resolution is not reached by the parties.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL,33138,Older American,Consent provided,Web,02-08-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8311378.0

I did this when I opened my account in person, I did this again in person when I added an additional account holder. I have done this on numerous occasions since, over the phone with customer service representatives. I believe I have banked with them since XXXX. 
Recently I have noticed bank over draft fees coming out of my account but then being credited back and was under the assumption that it was some sort of auto debit and credit that just happened and then refunded, except this week multiple fees were not refunded back and I called my bank. I was informed that I had opted in to this service and that the fees were not to be refunded unless the bank had made an error. My partner is paid weekly by direct deposit so there is always a weekly deposit made in to the bank. I am paid bi weekly also by direct deposit so there are additional monthly deposits. I looked as far back as I could on my mobile app in to over draft fees and since the end of XX/XX/XXXX I have calculated over XXXX fees of {$36.00} that have not been credited back. 
I asked customer service representative to provide me proof of when I opted in to this service and they wont give it to me, I asked for a full accounting of overdraft fees paid to date & to speak to supervisors and was denied. I asked to speak to legal department and was denied. I was hung up on finally. 
I have never opted in to these protections in fact I have specifically asked that if there was not enough money in the account to cover a transaction that it be declined. I have reiterated this request on multiple occasions over the span of I believe 8 years and over and over again this will seem to be the case until they start sneaking them by on me in larger and larger numbers as they have done before in the past until I call and make a stink about it again.

I was not home at the the time the package was delivered. They stated per terms and conditions of XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo has to abide by their conditions and I told them no that is not correct. You guys don't need to follow any of their terms and conditions specially if they were at fault. If this is the case than you are not allowing for consumers to dispute items that were never delivered and actually prevents customers from disputing charges for items that were never delivered. Just because an item is delivered does not mean it arrived to the receiver of the purchase. 

In this case the laptop was never delivered to me because I was not home at the time the delivery was made. The package required my signature and XXXX did not get my signature. All they did was write my name on the tracking information. XXXX XXXX would not work with me on this either.

02/16/25,Credit card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Comenity Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase at XXXX via the Comenity Bank Credit Card . The purchase was under a 6 month interest free promotional plan. The payoff needed to occur prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I purposefully scheduled the monthly payments in accurate intervals and ensured the payoff was going to occur mid XXXX. 

When I received the first statement, I noticed that the company began assessing a {$2.00} statement fee. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to have the fee removed. I was told that the only way to remove the fee was by enrolling into online statements. I enrolled into online statements but proceeded to get charged for a statement fee. I called the company again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that it could take a few billing cycles for the fee to stop. They refunded the second month 's fee as well. I subsequently stopped receiving the paper statements and did not see that the paper statement fees had continued for XXXX more months. 

Irrespective of this, I made sure to make the payoff payment well in advance of the promotion end date. As you can see from the attached statement transactions, I paid off {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Out of abundance of caution I called the company on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that the amount I paid is the payoff for the promotional purchase. The company represented confirmed that the payoff amount was correct. 

Subsequently, when I checked by statement on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that the company had assessed full interest on the XX/XX/XXXX promotional purchase in the amount of {$1100.00} and there were XXXX charges of {$2.00} for statement fees. 

I immediately contacted the company on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the promotional balance was not paid off and was short in the amount of {$5.00}, the amount of the statement fees and therefore, it was within their rights to charge the interest. I argued that the company erroneously and in a predatory fashion continued to charge the statement fees and that their company representative misled in her confirmation that no interest would be charged. The company representative noted that there was nothing she could do to assist. 

I then called the company again on XX/XX/XXXX and requested to escalate the matter to a manager and to the compliance team 's attention. I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX who stated that I was absolutely correct and that even if the statement fees were assessed and not refunded, those should've been part of the revolver and not added to the promotional purchase. She said that she would try everything she can to correct this error as she believed this to be an unjust situation as well. She requested my cell phone number and said that she will personally call me back after she speaks with her manager.

She returned my call within a few hours saying that her manager too could see what had happened but due to compliance reason could not approve a correction and removal of the interest. When I noted that not correcting is in fact a compliance issue, XXXX XXXX XXXX said that if they fix my account, they would have to do it for others. 

I would like for this predatory lending practice to be reviewed and report that I have been taken advantage of as a consumer by Comenity Bank. I have followed all procedures as described to me and intended not to pay interest and fees. I believe Comenity Bank has purposefully manipulated the account with not stopping the statement fees and then made false attempts in trying to rectify the situation. 

I have been left with no choice but to report this matter to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and if not resolved, will continue to escalate this predatory action to the States Attorney General for investigation.

These failures violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), and Regulation E.

Specifically, Cash App failed to take timely and effective measures to prevent and address fraud on their platform. Despite their obligation to implement reasonable security measures to protect customer accounts, my account was left vulnerable and unprotected, which resulted in unauthorized transactions.

Moreover, their dispute resolution process was unfair, deceptive, and noncompliant with the error resolution requirements under the EFTA and Regulation E. Regulation E mandates that financial institutions must investigate and resolve errors involving electronic fund transfers promptly, typically within 10 business days. Cash App failed to meet these requirements by either not conducting a thorough investigation or by dismissing my claim without adequate justification.

Under the EFTA and Regulation E, consumers are entitled to dispute unauthorized electronic fund transfers and seek reimbursement when fraud is reported in a timely manner. I notified Cash App promptly about the fraudulent activity on my account and provided all necessary details to support my claim. Despite this, Cash App has failed to provide the reimbursement I am entitled to under the law.

These actions have caused significant financial loss and inconvenience. I request the following : Immediate reimbursement for the unauthorized transactions, as required under the EFTA and Regulation E.

On XX/XX/2024, my XXXX XXXX XXXX phone was stolen, and I promptly filed a police report. Subsequently, I noticed unauthorized transactions on my Cash App debit card while I was out of town. I contacted Cash App support in XX/XX/2024 to dispute these transactions, but my account was closed, and I was informed that disputes could not be processed due to the account closure. 
Despite my repeated requests to send documentation through the mail, I received no response. Instead, I was informed that my disputes would be paused until I verified my identity. However, several disputes were processed and denied without verification, leading to a negative balance on my account. 
To process any disputes on the cash app on the phone, it asks to verify identity to process a dispute which I already have, several times. There is a total of 81 unauthorized transactions for a total of {$2600.00} I trust that Cash App values its customers and will address this matter promptly.

I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the recent permanent limitation placed on my PayPal account, registered under the email address XXXX. I believe that there has been a misunderstanding or mistake in this matter. 

First and foremost, I want to emphasize that I have always strived to abide by PayPal 's policies and guidelines diligently. I have not engaged in any activities that would warrant such a severe measure as a permanent account limitation. This situation has left me perplexed and distressed. 

I kindly request that PayPal conducts a thorough re-evaluation of my account 's limitation. I believe that upon further investigation, it will become evident that there has been no violation of PayPal 's policies from my end. I am committed to resolving any issues or concerns that may have led to this decision, and I am willing to provide any necessary documentation or information to support this appeal. 

My PayPal account has been an essential tool for me in managing my finances and conducting online transactions. Losing access to it has caused significant inconvenience, and I would like to see a fair resolution that restores my account 's functionality. 

I understand that PayPal 's primary concern is to maintain the security and integrity of its platform. However, I respectfully request that you give me the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and rectify any potential issues that may have led to this unfortunate situation.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and kindly ask that you expedite the review process to minimize any further disruption to my financial activities. Please feel free to contact me at XXXX if you require any additional information or clarification. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to a prompt and positive resolution of this matter.

At that point I felt something was wrong and I called the bank. 2 hours after receiving the fraud call I called the bank and told them what happened. I told them I didnt authorize and had no knowledge because I was tricked and fooled into logging into my account. The bank promised to freeze my account and place the transaction on hold. They also said that they would contact the other bank to let them know it was fraud. My account had a fraudulent wire transfer for {$1500.00} placed on hold and my account was frozen.

This issue has prevented me from filing a tax refund claim with the IRS before the XX/XX/XXXX, deadline for my XXXX taxes, potentially causing financial loss. 

Background : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, residing in the XXXX since XXXX. From XXXX to XXXX, I was a XXXX XXXX  and under U.S. tax law, my bank interest income should be tax-exempt. I hold multiple accounts with Wells Fargo, including numerous Time Accounts ( Certificates of XXXX ), with known account numbers XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX However, Wells Fargo did not request a XXXX form when these accounts were opened, resulting in 30 % of my interest income being withheld in XXXX and XXXX. I submitted a XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to correct this, but Wells Fargo failed to update my accounts, necessitating another submission in XX/XX/XXXX. After the XXXX submission, I successfully received a XXXX refund via Form XXXX, but I still lack the XXXX and XXXX records needed for prior refunds. 

Efforts to Resolve : I have made exhaustive attempts to obtain these documents : Phone Calls : I called Wells Fargos toll-free numbers ( including XXXX ) multiple times, but all calls were answered by automated systems with no option to speak to a human representative, preventing meaningful assistance. 
Branch Visits : I visited two branchesXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX several occasions, but staff were unable to provide the requested XXXX forms or resolve the issue.

I spoke to a male representative about fees on a business account I was not using. He also advised me to call the customer service number on the back of my card to get the fees removed. About XXXX weeks later, I received a fraud alert email from the bank for suspicious activities. I noticed small unauthorized debit transactions in my savings account and called the bank to report it. On XX/XX/year>, I learned that my personal information from Citizens Bank was used to open another savings account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I noticed an unauthorized ACH transfer of {$9500.00} from my savings account to XXXX XXXX. I called Citizens Bank immediately to report it, and the next day I went to the branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, I noticed the person who spoke to me needed more knowledge to address the situation. The men should've called the fraud department then ; but failed to do so. He told me the bank would investigate the case, which could take 4-8 business days, but they still need to look into it. A couple of days later, I called the fraud department to see the status of my case, and a representative told me the case was closed and resolved. The case shouldn't be closed, because the case was not resolved, and the funds were not back in my account. He made a report and gave me another case number. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX pm, I called XXXX XXXX to ask them about the unauthorized transfer. They found the account under my name, and the funds were there. I asked them to return the funds ; because I had not opened or authorized a new account They told me they would call Citizens Bank to reverse the funds, and they did. Overall, I noticed a lot of abnormalities from Citizens Bank 's handling of the situation. First, when I called to report suspicious activities regarding a small debit on my account, they stopped sending me further fraud alert messages. After I recovered the funds for {$9500.00}, I took them out of the account and closed it. Yet, when I checked another branch, the account was still open. I tried to close the account several times but it reopened again because someone was still trying to verify the account with XXXX. Due to the closeness of these interactions, I believe that my personal information was stolen from someone within the Citizens Bank. I think that was an employee with whom I got in contact when I asked to remove some fees from my business account because no one had information on my savings routing or account number. Another fact is, that other representatives from the bank confirmed that there were no traces or evidence that online banking was compromised. I've been getting letters with inquiries I didn't make. Another incident is now a {$400.00} and {$260.00} charge to my checking account through XXXX XXXX on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX of this year. I didn't authorize these transactions, but the bank did without my knowledge.

Dear Wells Fargo Executive Office,

I had reached out to you about the above account and was disputing the balance, and I got a notice I was not responsible and that the account balance would be updated and a new card mailed to me.

I am still waiting for the new card; the account balance must be resolved.

I continued making payments on the account as I have been in the hospital for months and will be released next week, but I was told this account would be on hold. I was told all interest and late fees would be refunded and stopped on my account, and I see that still needs to be done. I am trying to understand why my account is still like this. I tried to be proactive on this, but the balance of $XXXX still needs to be reflected, which should be different. This should be a XXXX  balance, and a new card should be issued immediately. 

I can't call in because I cannot speak, but this was resolved and is now outside the allowable time to resolve billing issues from when I reached out in XXXX. This needs to be corrected.

Please confirm this via email, or you must leave a message, as I can only access and reply to emails now. I want this balance removed and a new card issued to me.

2 Advertising Promotional Complaints against American Express for the Platinum Card : 1 ) Applied but did not receive the initial promotional offer. Was told that I was not entitled to it because I had a card prior. I accepted that although there was no disclosure at time of application that stated that limitation.

I called and was told to pay the {$250.00} and would then receive the certificate. I paid it but am now told that I have to paid a second annual fee before I will receive the certificate so what should have been a {$250.00} companion flight certificate now costs {$500.00}. 

The only choice Im being given now is to cancel but I will only receive {$200.00} refund because it has now been over 30 days since the fee was assessed.

They stated that I owed them {$13.00}. I claimed that I had overpaid {$9.00}. For decades, my payments to SB/JCP were for premiums to XXXX XXXX XXXX , for two insurance policies. This incident dropped my FICO Score by XXXX points. 

After countless telephone calls, to both SB/JCP and XXXX XXXX , I sent a detailed letter to SB/JCP. They admitted their mistake. I received a check, for my overpayment, and my XXXX  Score was restored to XXXX. 

-HOWEVER- Because of my countless 'phone calls, a second dispute had been opened, A Customer Service Representative XXXX XXXX, told XXXX that my payment of {$32.00} was never received. SB/JCP sent me an undated letter, asking for further documentation. SB/JCP wants : 1. An unredacted bank statement. 
2. A clear legible copy of the store register receipt, displaying the payment. 

The resolved, initial dispute had my Checking Bank Statement, showing that SB/JCP had deposited the {$32.00} ; and I sent the screenshot, emailed to me by SB/JCP, stating that my {$32.00} was processed, on XXXX. 
1. My redacted Checking Statement was accepted for the initial, resolved dispute. 
2. I didn't purchase anything at a store. As I stated in the first paragraph, monthly payments were for two insurance premiums. 

-HOWEVER- On the Checking Bank Statement, I had redacted my Balances ; and the Descriptions of other payments. I don't feel that SB/JCP needs to know that I charged groceries, utilities, medications ... and what my checking balance is. It's irrelevant to the dispute. The payment and amount paid to SB/JCP is unredacted. This unredacted item was accepted on the initial dispute. 
When I asked both a Customer Service Rep and a Supervisor why they need the whole bank statement unredacted, I was told, "" unredacted statements are the bank 's policy.

These violations are in direct contravention of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 1681, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 USC 6801, and associated regulations, particularly 12 CFR 1016.7. 
* Unauthorized Sharing of Personal InformationAccording to 15 USC 6801, it is the policy of Congress that each financial institution, which includes Furnisher of Information to Credit Agencies, has an obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and protect the confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. Despite this, neither [ Furnisher of Information to Credit Agencies ], nor Equifax and XXXX, obtained my written consent to furnish my personal information. Furthermore, 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) unequivocally states that a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. As such, any consent provided, whether implicit or otherwise, is hereby revoked.Relevant USC and CFR codes : 15 USC 6801, 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), 12 CFR 1016.7 * Failure to Inform of Nondisclosure Option15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) dictates that a financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how to exercise their nondisclosure option. [ Furnisher of Information to Credit Agencies ] failed to inform me of my right to exercise this option, thereby breaching this legal requirement.Relevant USC and CFR codes : 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) * Reporting of Unauthorized Adverse ItemPer 15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ), no consumer reporting agency may include adverse information in a consumer report without authorization, unless it falls under specific exceptions, which do not apply in this case. Equifax and XXXX are reporting adverse information without my permission, a clear violation of the law.Relevant USC code : 15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) * Failure to Maintain Reasonable Procedures15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) explicitly states that a person shall not furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Equifax and XXXX are in breach of this provision by furnishing inaccurate information. Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that consumer reporting agencies must maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of FCRA. Equifax and XXXX have failed to maintain such procedures.Relevant USC codes : 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ), 15 U.S. Code 1681e In light of these serious violations of federal law, I demand immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that my personal information is not inaccurately reported and shared without my explicit written consent. I am seeking the maximum penalty of {$1000.00} per violation, as allowed by law. 

Per the fcra as a federally protection consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written unwritten verbal non verbal per 15 usc 6802 I am also invoking my right under 12 CFR 1016.7 to opt out of your reporting services with immediate effect. been trying to solve this problem for some time with your agency and the corporations and debt collectors you allowed to put fraudulent inaccurate items on my credit report without permissible purpose.

04/14/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to file a formal complaint against XXXX Chase Bank regarding the forced closure of my credit card accounts and discriminatory restrictions placed on my transactions, which I believe constitute unfair and retaliatory practices. 
Background and Timeline : In XXXX, I submitted a complaint to Chase Bank, providing evidence of what I believed to be fraudulent or unethical conduct by the bank. 
Shortly after submitting my complaint, XXXX forcibly closed my existing credit card account ( ending in XXXX ) without providing a clear or justified reason, other than referencing a vague pattern of abuse of the claims process. 
In XXXX, I was approved for a new Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card. However, I soon discovered that Chase was blocking all of my transactions on XXXX, even though my account was in good standing and my credit limit was sufficient. 
After several declined XXXX transactions, Chase again closed my new account, citing the same unsubstantiated reason as before. 
Evidence : I have attached screenshots showing : My account status as closed with a {$0.00} balance and no available credit, despite pending transactions. 
Multiple declined XXXX transactions, even though my account was open and in good standing at the time. 
The official closure notice from Chase, which references activity reflecting a pattern of abuse of the claims process but provides no specific evidence or explanation. 
My Concerns : Chases actions appear retaliatory, as the forced closures and transaction blocks began only after I reported their alleged misconduct. 
The bank has not provided any concrete evidence or due process to support its claims of abuse of the claims process. 
Blocking all XXXX transactions and then using this as a pretext to close my account is discriminatory and restricts my ability to use my credit card as intended. 
These actions have negatively impacted my credit, caused financial inconvenience, and denied me access to services without valid justification. 
Requested Resolution : I request that the CFPB investigate Chases practices regarding account closures and transaction restrictions, especially in cases where the customer has previously filed complaints against the bank.

I ask that Chase provide a detailed explanation and evidence for the account closures and transaction blocks. I request that my account be reinstated or that I be allowed
to open a new account without arbitrary restrictions or retaliation.

I seek assurance that Chase will not discriminate against me or other customers for filing complaints or using their accounts in a lawful manner.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am attaching all relevant documentation, including account statements, screenshots of declined transactions, and the closure notice, to support my complaint.

( b ) Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee can not acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument. 

( c ) Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a promotional email from American Express Bank. The email was personalized with my name and was specifically targeted at me as a valued card member. The offer was enticing : a {$350.00} cash bonus if I deposited {$25000.00} or more into a new American Express High Yield Savings account by XX/XX/, and maintained that balance through XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Believing in the credibility of American Express and the clarity of the offer, I promptly deposited the required amount into the new account. In fact, my account was credited with {$25000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, well before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. I made sure to maintain the balance as stipulated in the offer, expecting the bank to honor its promise. I maintained these funds until XXXX or XXXX, well beyond the required period. 

Despite my numerous attempts to resolve this issue with the bank, I have not received any satisfactory response or the promised bonus. This experience has left me feeling misled and unfairly treated. The bank 's failure to honor its promise and its lack of clear communication regarding the offer 's conditions have caused me considerable stress and disappointment. 

I have reached out to the bank 's customer service multiple times, only to be asked to wait, sometimes for as long as 15 days. Each time, I am given vague responses and promises of escalation to the corporate office, but to no avail. The bank continues to buy more time, leaving me in a state of uncertainty and frustration. It appears that the bank is using delay tactics and providing baseless reasons for not crediting the promised bonus. 

I kindly request your intervention in this matter. I believe that consumers should be able to trust the promotional offers they receive, especially from reputable institutions like American Express Bank. I am attaching all relevant documents, including the screenshot of the exact offer I received, the terms and conditions mentioned in the offer, and my bank statements showing the balance maintained throughout the offer period.

What happened was I transferred {$35.00} to another account and didn't realize that it was my own account because I forgot and I reported it. My account was immediately frozen and when I attempted to resolve the issue, I could no longer transfer money from my bank account into my Venmo account. Then in XXXX of this year, I legally changed my name for personal reasons, so I decided that since I couldn't fix the old account, I would attempt to create a new account under my new name. It seemed to work, but upon receiving my Venmo debit card, my account was immediately suspended. I have since sent numerous emails about the situation to Venmo 's support team and made numerous phone calls. Venmo has failed to unfreeze my account or allow me to add any bank account because my bank account is tied to the other account and my joint checking account with my husband is tied to his own Venmo account. This issue has been escelated numerous times and yet, I still can not use my Venmo account over a matter of {$35.00}, which I told them I would put back into my Venmo account if they would just allow me to add a bank account. I should not have to open a new bank account just to fix an error that Venmo created. It should absolutely not take more than a year to resolve any issue with a financial institution and Venmo customer service further refuses to allow me to talk to someone who can actually resolve the issue. Their customer support team has put me on hold more than once, often leaving me on hold for 45 minutes to an hour until I eventually hang up and call back in. The support team is rude and completely unhelpful and none of them can actually troubleshoot any issues.

I called the number on the text message, instead of answering the yes or no question, believing that I was communicating with Chase bank fraud dept. The scammers used the same type of IA recording that the bank uses and asked the exact same type of questions the bank ask, whenever I call the bank. They sent a text message with a code, and they wanted to know what the code was. My bank also does exact same thing. The scammers said that my debit card would be deactivated, and another one would be expedited and sent to me. They asked if I had been to XXXX Ohio, this is where the card was used at. So, I asked how can someone get my debit card number, and they stated that a scanner was used, possibly at store or gas station to retrieve the debit card number. They kept me on the phone for quite some time stating that they were correcting the issue ( but in actually they were wiping out our savings accounts ). I was also informed that a wire transfer was done and sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was asked if I had authorized this transaction, I stated that I did not authorize any transfers of any kind. They also stated that they would report the crime to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and will continue to monitor my account for any other fraudulent activity. Later that afternoon, I received a total of XXXX different emails from what I thought was from Chase Bank. One of them was telling me that a wire transfer had been completed successfully for another amount that I did not authorize, so this time I contacted Chase Bank Customer Dept. and at that time I was informed that it was not the real Chase Bank Fraud Dept. that I had been communicating with earlier. The scammers also hacked my cell phone and was having all of my calls forwarded to their number at XXXX. The scammers wiped out our savings accounts for a total of {$49000.00}, through Chase online banking. Chase Bank has denied the claim stating that I could have benefited from the items taken, and will not refund our money to us. The money was sent to someone named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  acct # XXXX in Texas. XXXX XXXX refunded us a total {$740.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a supervisor at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. and I was informed that I had no recourse for the balance due. This person has stolen all of our savings and neither of these banks are willing to help us. I have filed a complaint with the FTC report # XXXX, a police report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Case # XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and IC3 ( Internet Crime Complaint Center XX/XX/XXXX. 
These scammers are so good, they used the exact same logo as Chase Bank, their IA recording, stating that my call would be recorded and their email address addresses, and Chase bank 's XXXX  text number when they are requesting your XXXX code. They ask me the exact same questions as Chase did when I called them later that day. To the point that I felt like, I was being scammed again. So, on XX/XX/XXXX me and my husband went into the bank to speak to representative at the branch. He stated that our online banking account has been locked and the hackers has changed the XXXX address. The branch could not get into the account. I feel that our money is not safe in these banks with the scammers getting away with wiping out all of a customers life savings with no recourse. Something else needs to be done to STOP this now. Not once were we notified in any way that the accounts had been wiped out no text message of phone call for such a large amount. And XXXX month prior I transfer {$100.00} from my savings to my checking and my husband received a text message regarding this amount, but nothing when XXXX was sent by wire transfer to strangers..",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,30519,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/25/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8623070.0

To illustrate the emotional toll, allow me to share a personal story. As I stood before my dream home, the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice, I was met with the crushing reality of the negative impact these inaccuracies have had on my credit score.

I implore you to take immediate action to rectify these injustices. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), it is my right to have accurate and verified information on my credit report. These unverified accounts not only violate my rights but also contribute to a cycle of financial distress that I am struggling to overcome. 

In light of these circumstances, I formally request that you enforce my legal rights under the FCRA and other relevant laws by : Investigating and verifying the accuracy of the disputed accounts. 
Removing any unverified accounts from my credit report. 
Providing me with written documentation of the investigation and resolution. 
I understand the vital role credit reporting agencies play in our financial system, and I trust that you will treat my case with the utmost care and urgency it deserves.

I called the customer service number and was advised that I would have to sign up for internet access to the account. I am not comfortable to do this because I feel that that allows for additional possibilities for my information to be compromised. 

I feel that this is an excessive charge that is in line with usury fees. The standard interest fee is 29.99 %.

Over the last XXXX months, my account incurred multiple overdraft fees due to an unexpected delay in receiving my paycheck. This was a temporary and unusual situation, and I did my best to address it immediately once I became aware of the issue. Despite this, I was charged overdraft fees totaling nearly $ XXXXincluding multiple {$34.00} chargeseven though I explained the circumstances and requested assistance. 

I contacted customer service several times to explain my situation, emphasizing my history as a long-time, responsible customer. Each time, I was told the system rejected my refund request due to reaching a limit. I then spoke with a supervisor, who repeated the same information without offering any further help or reviewing my account in a meaningful way. 

This response is extremely disappointing and does not reflect the level of customer care I expect from a financial institution Ive trusted for over a decade. The lack of empathy and unwillingness to make any accommodation, despite my clear explanation and financial hardship, has caused me significant stress and financial difficulty. 

I am requesting a full review of my account and a refund of these overdraft fees. I believe this request is fair given my long-standing relationship with Chase and the unusual nature of this situation. 

If this matter is not resolved, I will consider escalating the issue through other channels, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant consumer advocacy organizations. 

I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and hope to see it resolved promptly and fairly.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,90028,,Consent provided,Web,04-12-2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,12954875.0

The reservation was made through a third-party booking platform, XXXX, and the charge was processed via our Bread Financial XXXX XXXX credit card. 

Our trip was scheduled from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. However, due to Hurricane Milton, all flights into Florida were suspended, and we were forced to reschedule our travel plans. We moved our vacation to begin on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife contacted XXXX to adjust the hotel check-in date accordingly. During that call, a representative confirmedvia a recorded callthat the reservation check-in date had been successfully changed to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Upon our arrival in Florida, my wife contacted the hotel to inquire about early check-in, only to be informed that our reservation had been canceled due to a no-show on the original check-in date of XX/XX/XXXX. Because the reservation was made through a third-party provider, the hotel was unable to assist us or offer a refund. 

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue with XXXXsupported by both an audio recording of the date change and a complete chat log of the correspondenceno resolution was offered. To this day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX has provided no assistance or reimbursement. 

As we did not receive the services we paid for, we disputed the {$3000.00} charge with Bread Financial on XX/XX/XXXX. The dispute was resolved in our favor, and we were issued a full credit for the amount. Bread Financial also mailed us a letter confirming that the charge was deemed fraudulent. 

However, in XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the disputed charge had been re-applied to my account without any prior communication. This was particularly concerning as my account had been paid in full and was on autopay, resulting in interest accruing on the re-applied amount without my knowledge. Since then, Bread Financial has refused to speak with us by phone, instead directing us to send a formal Letter of Intent. We complied, mailing a certified letter on XX/XX/XXXX, allowing 10 business days for a response. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, we have received no reply, phone call, or email. 

Additionally, there are discrepancies in the transaction log. Bread Financial appears to have recorded all three transactionsthe original charge, the credit, and the re-chargeon the same date : XX/XX/XXXX. This is inconsistent with the actual timeline, as the original booking occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Below is a breakdown of the relevant transactions, all showing the same transaction date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), which is incorrect : Original Charge : XXXX, XXXX. XXXX {$3000.00} Dispute Credit : XXXX TRANSFER FRAUD ( XXXX  ) XXXX  - {$3000.00} Re-applied Charge : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$3000.00} ( Note : This description differs from the original charge ) As of XX/XX/XXXX, our credit card account reflected a credit balance of - {$15.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, a new charge of {$2900.00} appeared ( approximately matching the disputed amount ), reintroducing the same issue without explanation.",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",IN,463XX,,Consent provided,Web,04/18/25,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,13055612.0

Upon examination, I identified multiple instances where my personal information was incorrectly reported. To my dismay, these inaccuracies have unfairly marred my creditworthiness and financial standing. The addresses listedXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXare entirely unfamiliar to me and bear no relation to my current or previous residences. These inaccuracies, I believe, are a direct violation of the FCRA, Section 607, as they inaccurately report personal information, adversely affecting my financial reputation.

Adding to this distressing situation, I discovered several unauthorized credit inquiries that have been made on my behalf. These unauthorized inquiries, I believe, breach my rights under the FCRA, Section 611, as they were conducted without my consent. These unauthorized inquiries include those made by XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  on various dates in XX/XX/XXXX. I can categorically affirm that I have no recollection of authorizing these credit pulls, and I implore your assistance in rectifying this blatant disregard for consumer rights. 

I am also deeply troubled by the inaccuracies in the reporting of certain accounts. Specifically, the entries related to the following accounts contain false information regarding late payments. These inaccuracies are a violation of the FCRA, Section 607, as they misrepresent my credit history and significantly damage my credit score. I have never made late payments on these accounts, and I demand that these inaccuracies be corrected immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. 
Beyond the financial implications, I wish to share a deeply personal aspect of how these violations have impacted my life. As a dedicated professional striving to build a secure future for my family, these inaccuracies have placed unwarranted obstacles in my path. The emotional distress caused by these discrepancies has been profound. My efforts to secure housing, employment, and even simple credit transactions have been met with unjustified skepticism due to the tarnished image presented by these inaccuracies. The stress and frustration have strained relationships, caused sleepless nights, and undermined my sense of security and self-worth. 

In light of the aforementioned violations and their far-reaching consequences, I humbly request your intervention and support in enforcing the legal provisions designed to protect consumers like me. I urge you to direct the concerned creditors to diligently investigate the matters I have raised and to correct the inaccuracies within my credit reports. Specifically, I kindly request the removal of the unverified and inaccurate accounts detailed in this letter. It is my fervent hope that by doing so, justice will be served and my faith in the fairness of the financial system can be restored. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to upholding consumer rights, and I am grateful for your assistance in rectifying this distressing situation. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.

See below the attached email with this information. The email from CapitalOne does not state the offer I selected. I am enrolled in paperless billing & documents. I do not have any document or email stating which offer I selected. 

Continued making weekly/biweekly payments. 



XXXX I noticed XXXX and XXXX had been charged interest, despite my transfer offer providing no interest for 18 months. 

XXXX Contacted XXXX at XXXX for 1 hour and 39 minutes. I was transferred to XXXX, supervisor, from the representative. I requested documentation as proof of why I was being held responsible for a balance that is now accumulating a large amount of interest, as it defeated the purpose of initiating a balance transfer, which is why I selected the 0 % for 18 mo and was aware and willing to pay the 3 % transfer fee. She stated this must be escalated to the back office teams for credit cards in order to retrieve that type of information. I requested that the note contain my lack of email, document center document, mail, or transaction specifying which offer was selected. Also, that my offers tab still had both offers active. I requested they change the balance transfer type to what I originally selected, reverse the interest charges, and provide proof of in-app offer selection. After this was submitted, XXXX advised it would take 7-10 days for a response. She also stated she would make a new calendar event to reach back out to me on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to follow up if my request was denied. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX for 28 minutes I spoke with XXXX XXXX. I stated the above information and requested an update since XXXX did not reach out to me. She read me the response from the back office stating they will not reverse the charges or change the offer selection. I asked what evidence they had that resulted in their decision. I again repeated that I was not provided with any documentation to utilize as proof of what offer I selected, which is very out of the ordinary. I asked what other documentation aside from the initial transaction and no 3 % fee transaction that they could see was used. XXXX stated their response again and said they dont provide that type of information. I asked once again, if I dont have any documentation as proof nor does Capital One, how is this a fair resolution? XXXX stated the back office is the highest it could have been escalated and there were no other options to resolve this. I requested to see in writing the back-office response she read to me and was denied.

07/18/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"This was the email sent to executives at BMO - On XXXX,2025, I visited your XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX ) to withdraw {$6800.00}. After verifying my ID and debit card, the teller escalated my request to some department on the phone. After about 10 minutes of waiting I was then informed by branch manager XXXX XXXX that my account was under review due to recent wire transfers, including deposits from XXXX ( an online cryptocurrency exchange ). 

The manager stated the fraud department would take 3090 days to verify these deposits. This would leave me without access to essential funds... not only to pay rent and support my sick mother in Michigan, but also with a baby on the way in less than three weeks!

This situation is untenable. I have never experienced something like this at any previous bank ( XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). Furthermore, under the Expedited Funds Availability Act ( Regulation CC ), electronic depositsincluding wiresmust generally be made available in full by the next business day. While there are provisions for reasonable holds on large or suspicious deposits, those apply to checks, not direct electronic transfers like wires.

If BMO is deciding to close my account, I expect the full balance to be issued via cashiers check without delay. I refuse to wait 30+ days while facing eviction and hardship.This situation is not just financially devastating but its deeply personal and degrading. To make matters worse, I cant ignore the feeling that I was treated with suspicion not because of the facts, but because of who I am- a brown man walking into a bank to withdraw cash. Instead of being treated like a valued customer, I was treated like a threat. Ive done nothing wrong. Ive never committed fraud. I have a clean record. Every dollar in my account is hard-earned and legitimate. And yet here I am, being punished for simply needing to use my own funds.

Now, over {$25000.00} of my money is being frozen with no clear justification or timeline for resolution. I am behind on rent. I had to borrow cash from friends just to buy food yesterday. My mother is ill in Michigan and I send her support. I have my first child arriving in less than three weeks. What am I supposed to do? How is this humane? How am I supposed to eat and live? Please think as a human rather than a corporate representative. Ive attached my babys ultrasound to help you understand the seriousness of my situation. In just a couple weeks, Ill be bringing a child into this world and Im truly at a loss. How am I supposed to explain to my newborn that I cant afford basic necessities like food or clothing because BMO has decided to withhold my funds?

This is my only personal checking account, and yet BMO is holding my entire balance XXXX, acting as if I can survive without access to a XXXX XXXX  for 3090 days. Ive never experienced anything like this at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX, or any bank Ive ever used before. 

I have attached documentation for all recent wires and XXXX withdrawals. I intend to follow up daily at the number provided ( XXXX ), via email, or in person at a local branch, including escalating to headquarters or media outlets if necessary.

These problems have escalated to the point where my funds have been withheld, and my accounts are now closed without a clear explanation. 

To summarize : Deposit Issue : I mobile deposited a check from one of my company vendor partners into my account. The money cleared, but I later received an email stating multiple accounts would be closed due to fraud. 
First Response : When I contacted the bank, I was informed that I was not listed as the owner of the company the check was issued to and that the company was no longer active. I immediately confirmed information was incorrect during phone call and had my name added to the registered site as instructed ( I'm a silent partner in the company ). 
Further Confusion : After providing proof of ownership ( via fax from the company CEO ), I was told that the issue was related to needing further documentation. However, even after these steps, my account was still restricted, and I was unable to access my funds.

Ac

count Closure : Four days later, my savings account was closed. When I followed up, I was told my checking account would also be closed, and the deposited funds would not be released to me. Vendor Verification : The bank then requested that I verify th
e legitimacy of the company that issued the check. However, when I provided two phone numbers for verification, the bank claimed both numbers were not valid numbers based of their number check system. These are the same numbers we have used for years to communicate with the company and receive service requests, so this was highly confusing. 
Escalation Attempts : After attempting to resolve the issue, I had the CEO partner of my company contact the bank to speak directly with a representative. During this call, the representative disconnected without explanation. 
The most concerning aspect of this situation is that the bank has previously processed checks from the same vendor without any issue. Now, I am being accused of fraud despite having the business account being in both my name as well since im the personal guarantor with all the correct documentation. If the bank has allowed these transactions in the past as a courtesy, it raises serious questions about their handling of my accounts and whether I have been wrongfully flagged. 

I request immediate clarification on the following : Why were my accounts flagged for fraud despite providing all requested documentation and verifying my identity? 
Why is the bank now refusing to release my funds after previously processing checks from the same vendor without issue? 
What is the next step I need to take to resolve this situation and restore access to my funds? 
I would appreciate a prompt response and resolution to this matter, as this has now become an urgent issue affecting my personal and business finances.

Background : I had a perfect payment record with American Express : no late payments, no balance, and no debt at all on the account. 
On XX/XX/year>, American Express cancelled my account without any prior warning or explanation, despite my perfect record. 
At the time of the cancellation, I had accumulated XXXX XXXX XXXX points, which were stored on my American Express account. 

Issues : After receiving the cancellation notice, I was informed in writing that I had 90 days to redeem my rewards points. 
For the past 30 days, I have been diligently calling American Express to redeem these points. Initially, I was told that the points would be converted into a balance that I could request as a refund. This was a suitable resolution for me at the time, but it has yet to be fulfilled. 
I have called American Express five times since then and even have a case open with them under Case ID : XXXX. I was told to wait XXXX business days for the matter to be resolved, but today marks XXXX business days with no resolution. 
When I called back today, I was told by a supervisor that the case would need to be re-opened, further delaying the process. 

Concerns : I believe this situation constitutes fraud. I spent my hard-earned money to accrue these rewards points, and those points have monetary value. American Expresss refusal to allow me to redeem my points, despite their prior assurances, is deeply concerning. 
I am entitled to the rewards that I earned, and American Expresss delay tactics feel like an attempt to withhold these benefits. 

I request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that American Express upholds its commitment to allow me to redeem my rewards points. Their lack of follow-through and continued delays have caused significant inconvenience, and I believe they are acting in bad faith. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your help in getting this issue resolved.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,900XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/23/24,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10551626.0

My XXXX  is way better and they don't rob me or scam me. I completely stopped using their cards. I had paid off everything as my credit score is very good and I don't want to ruin it.

I have grown adult children and use this credit card to secure their college tuition. 
In XXXX I gave birth to a XXXX XXXX with a XXXXXXXX XXXX 
I had no problem making the payments even through several of her XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 
During the time of the covid pandemic I righteously made my payments. 
I have reached out to discover every XXXX months to XXXX XXXX  to see if there is a way to lower the interest payments I have paid over {$8000.00} in interest, each time they indicate to me that that is the card I have. 
Recently I reached back out to them Indicating that we are considering filing bankruptcy they offered me a XXXX months interest program which I accepted and completed during that. Of time I also paid {$150.00} over the minimum payment. my card is on auto pay and has been for over XXXX  years. 
Upon completing the program they told me I could not get into another program for a year they could offer me nothing more than lower interest on future purchases. 
That is not the quality standard I have if I can not make the payments on the purchases I have I'm certainly not going to be making any further purchases as I haven't there's absolutely no activity on the account and has been no activity on the account I am merely paying years of interest. 
I called discover every XXXX months to a year to see if there's any options and there is absolutely no options with them. the representative filed a complaint on my behalf as it's indicated I have diligently tried to come to an agreement with discover or a payoff or any financial offers in there isn't any the only offer they have is to go delinquent and incur more interest and have a negative XXXX XXXX and negative credit reports. 
So today XX/XX/XXXX I took my account off auto payments Recalled discover to see if there was absolutely anything I could do again the answer was no. 
My daughter is going under another XXXX XXXX and her medical is more important to me than a company that just refuses to work with you and give no options other than to negatively affect my personal and financial credit.

01/28/25,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",International money transfer,Money was not available when promised,,"I am filing a complaint against Huntington National Bank regarding the delayed release of funds belonging to my late brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite following all required procedures and submitting the necessary documents, the bank has refused to release the money. 

Details of the Case : My brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX citizen, passed away on XX/XX/year>. He had a personal account ( No. XXXX ) with Huntington National Bank, XXXX XXXX, with a balance of {$24000.00}. The bank requested legal documents to process the claim, which we provided in full. The case number given by the bank is XXXX. Documents Provided : On XX/XX/year>, I visited the XXXX XXXX in XXXX and submitted the following documents : Death Certificate of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Limitation of Inheritance listing the four legal heirs : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Division Certificate These documents were authenticated by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and certified with the U.S. Consular Seal. This confirms their validity for legal use in the United States. 

XXXX XXXX : The bank is asking for a notarized affidavit, but in XXXX, notarized affidavits do not exist. Instead, we have provided officially certified documents, which are legally accepted. The bank has lost the documents twice after we sent them via XXXX. To avoid further losses, I emailed scanned copies directly. We provided a legal reference to the Ohio law [ R.C. XXXX ], which allows the release of small estate funds under {$35000.00} without complex legal procedures. Important Information About the Estate : No funeral costs : The XXXX XXXX covered all burial expenses, so there are no outstanding debts. No other assets : XXXX XXXX did not own any stocks, bonds, vehicles, or real estateonly the funds in XXXX XXXX Bank. No outstanding claims : He left the XXXX over 20 years ago, and all clearances with XXXXXXXX XXXX were completed. Challenges for the Family : All four heirs are over XXXX XXXX XXXX, and one is XXXX XXXX XXXX  making it impossible to travel to the U.S. to resolve this matter in person. The bank failed to advise Mr. Fuad to name a beneficiary, which is why this issue has become complicated. Requested Resolution : Immediate release of funds through cashiers checks, divided equally among the four heirs. A six-month validity period for these checks to allow enough time for collection. Direct contact with the general manager at Huntington National Bank to resolve this issue quickly. 

We have done everything required, followed all legal steps, and provided authenticated documents. Yet, the bank is delaying the process by insisting on documents that are not part of XXXX legal system. This has caused unnecessary frustration and hardship. 

I kindly request your urgent assistance in ensuring the bank processes this claim without further delay.

Despite fulfilling all verification requirements, my account remains locked, and I have encountered numerous problems with Robinhoods customer support. 

Here are the details of my complaint : Account Restrictions and Verification : My Robinhood account was restricted, and I was instructed to provide certain verification documents. I promptly submitted all requested information, yet my account remains inaccessible. I even received an email from Robinhood stating that the restrictions had been lifted, but this was not the case.

Customer Support Challenges : Every time I try to contact Robinhoods customer support, whether by phone ( including when using a landline ) or through the Robinhood app, the representatives either act as if the service is unavailable or immediately disconnect the call. Additionally, they fail to complete support chats within the app, which prevents me from requesting further assistance for hours. This deliberate lack of follow-through has left me unable to resolve my issue and continues to create an impossible situation for me to get any resolution.

It feels as though Robinhood has intentionally set up their system to make it difficult, if not impossible, for customers to have their issues addressed. I am left feeling frustrated and helpless, unable to access my funds or receive proper customer support.

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist me in getting my account fully unlocked and restored. I would appreciate any guidance on how to proceed, as Robinhood has failed to provide a satisfactory solution. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt assistance.

First, i have never had a CD automatically renewed at such a below market rate. To me that is a scam to enroll people into below market rates Second, to receive notification after the grace period is ridiculous and i should have been able to close the CD without penalty.

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received a XXXX  envelope inside I received a check dated XX/XX/25 check number XXXX in the amount of {$420.00} memo states close out disbursement I decided to collect data before I called Citibank to complain On XX/XX/25 I called XXXX to verify that my {$700.00} deposit went through. They said I would have to check with the institution I sent it from which was my usual Bank. 
I went to my bank in town and verified that the {$700.00} disbursement went via XXXX and XXXX confirmed that they did make the payment On. XX/XX/25 at XXXX XXXX  I called to complain to Citibank that I had made a {$700.00} deposit by XXXX and a mobile check deposit in the amount of {$570.00} For a total of {$1200.00} I also complained that I received a check dated XX/XX/25 check number XXXX in the amount of {$420.00} memo states close out disbursement The clothes out disbursement was nowhere near the amount that I had deposited. I shouldve received a check for. {$1200.00}. 
They told me to call back in XXXX hours. 
I called again on XX/XX/25 at XXXX XXXX  I was told they would have to call whomever issued the check to make sure that it was cashed I reiterated that I have an email verified a receipt of the mobile deposit, but she said nonetheless they still had to call the check issuers Due to the lateness of the hour, they were unable to reach the issues of the check so they told me to call back the next day. 
I called back on XX/XX/25 at XXXX XXXX  the line cut short and I called back at XXXX XXXX  And again at XXXX XXXX  I was told that they did verify the {$700.00} deposit transaction by the transaction number and they did verify that the check was deposited via mobile deposit and accepted I said it was imperative that I have this money right away and she told me she would try and reinstate my account On XX/XX/25 by XXXX  envelope. I received a debit card that I could not Activate because it did not accept my pin On XX/XX/25 at XXXX XXXX  I called Citibank again to complain that the automated system did not accept my pin to activate the card. They told me they could activate it through this phone call. 
They said that they activated it and the amount in the account was {$570.00} ironically, this is identical to the amount of the check I did for mobile deposit however, the check I received for {$420.00} they told me that the first time I use my card in any accepted ATM. I can set my pin. 
I further complained that the debit card had no CVV Card Verification Value printed on card so it would be impossible to use to make any purchases Meanwhile, the total disbursement that they have given me is an account with a supposed worth of {$570.00} plus a final disbursement check of {$420.00} Together these XXXX comprise a total of {$990.00} The difference is that Citibank still owes me {$270.00}. 
I am afraid to withdraw my money or to cash the check that they sent me because I dont want them to have any legal recourse to say that I accepted that as complete payment I need Citibank to either deposit {$220.00} in my account in addition to the {$570.00} that is in the account so so that the account totals {$850.00} Alternatively, they can send me another check in the amount of {$220.00} by overnight courier.

04/30/24,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"FYI see no account number associated with the equity account. I will upload the little information I can as I called and I also can not locate the funds anymore online and it shows no history... 

I called ML on XX/XX/2024, to dissolve my equity plan and over a month later, I still have not received my check, the same check that was told to me on XX/XX/2024 was being mailed, the same rep I also asked to submit my complaint as I had to waste more of my time to find out, once again the previous XXXX  did not provide all the details. Per the first rep today XXXX.24 ( I called twice, trying to give them one last chance before submitting the complaint ), there are no notes in the account for the XXXX XXXX when the rep stated he was mailing the check since I did not want to pay the XXXX wire fee, which wasnt shared previously. Not only did this XXXX  not do his job, lied and clearly did not forward my complaint to anyone. Why is the ML employee accessing customers profile without leaving any notes? How many customers are in the same boat as me, ML opting out of providing full services, not giving partial information? I was not aware ML had the authority to misinform clients... 
I tried my best to withdraw the funds myself as I knew it would be bau ( business as usual ), nightmare customer experience and I was right, unfortunately. As you may have imagined, of course my funds are no longer displayed anywhere online anymore. 
This type of customer experience is not just tied to equity, earlier this year I tried to get my 401k transferred to my current employer multiple times, I literally got so fed up with the receiving tiny pieces of information and wasting hours. I have done 401k transfers and this is the first and only time I experienced issues. Nothing from XXXX  nothing from XXXX, but ML likes to be number 1, and make things as difficult as it possibly can be. 
Perhaps this is their goal, make customers so frustrated they get to keep my money and invest it so that I can not invest my own money how I want. While I do not know the exact amount ML have caused me to lose, I know its cost me money on compound interest as well as interest as my current employer rate of return is at 4.67 %, while ML is only XXXX both YTD. While I may consult an attorney on that issue but I think its worth the CFPB to see if this used as a tool, similarly how banks continue to deny XXXX people mortgages at a high rate while, XXXX with similar and lower credit and income. 
This has been entirely too time consuming and difficult as a XXXX veteran that suffers from XXXX XXXX, Im exhausted mentally and physically. 
At least they are consistent, they are the one company I will also ensure you have the worst customer experience every time and are always sure to waste my time. 
While I can not recall which regulation is applicable at this moment, I can not imagine brokerage/equity not being under lots of scrutiny and I can not image that ML can forgo to give me my money. How many times do I have to ask for my money to receive it? 
Have I gone through enough hoops to receive the XXXX? I know for the 401k, I did not so they get to keep making me lose money due to the 100 feet hurdles. 
I have called approximately 5 times to equity, which also equates to about 4-5 hours of hold and wait time and this includes today call when I learned that my funds have not been mailed as told on XX/XX/XXXX. I even gave a second chance after the first rep told me should could not identify my number even after I have gone through this process with each of her colleagues, one of them earlier this year updated my number and now all of sudden the information doesn't match, how convenient How convenient, that no XXXX  was available, and even more convenient did not offer to find one and place me on hold or ask me am I okay waiting for one I asked her to just end the call so I could at least answer the questions on the survey I was selected. I sure wish I was related to senior leadership so I can receive the service that is provide to them ML failed and continue to fail me over, over and over again! I want nothing more than to never in my life have to deal with this company, they have taken away so much of my time. As a XXXX veteran who has XXXX XXXX to go through so many obstacles each and every time. It is hard enough living with a XXXX but also have to deal with companies that do not have any respect of people to at least do their job. I am not asking for top rated customers services ; I am just asking for them to do give me all information and send me money, which is their job. The best service is always the one you dont have to keep calling, they did it right the first time. This would never be tolerated in the military, we take our core values seriously, honor courage and commitment. 

I called and wasted just as much or more time with their 401k department. 
Root cause. 
In XXXX XXXX  I believe his name was XXXX failed. Failed to provide fee with wire, I would not pay this company anything else, my time and lost of money is far past the price anyone should ever have to pay. 
Simply could have entered in the system for the check to be mailed once cleared. I would have not had to call and waste about 3 more hours for a check. I have literally lost the money that should have been shopping spree as my time was undervalued and I wouldve earned more had I actually been on the clock working, cant get my time back and apparently transferred are only asynchronous never to be given to the customer. 
I loathe this company and I hope the CFPB is able to assist and looking for counsel ( 401k still losing money, couldn't get them funds either.

02/18/25,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Trouble accessing funds in your mobile or digital wallet,,"So I have been a XXXX user for a while sometimes I use it more than my regular bank account. I find it an easy way to receive and send money between friends and family and make secure payments online. Its been a big part of my life recently and I have heard horror stories of peoples accounts being deactivated for having the wrong word inside the description when somebody sent something or all their money being locked out and they say 180 days and it takes way longer. Im having an issue where my account was frozen and then seven hours later from an automated message which I know it was an automated message because there was no customer support or anybody because it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and I even had a customer service representative over the phone from the day before on Saturday. Explain to me that there wont be anybody there on Monday and I was told that within 3 to 5 business days, my account should be unfrozen because the biggest reason your account can pretty much be frozen is if you owe funds to a bank or institution of some sort, but for any other reasons, it can be frozen. You have to reach out with email and they can only chat with you Monday through Friday.  I asked them is there anyway we could put a notation on the account to expedite or escalate the situation because Ive been waiting on that money for a long time and were out of food in the house. My animal doesnt have any food we have bills that are past due that need to be paid immediately And on our budget were going to need that money to pay the rent. This is a giant hamper in my life and my fiancs life, and we can lose absolutely everything over, just receiving some vague and unreliable prompt, which was an automated message from apparently the advanced account specialist through email. When I thought 3 to 5 business days, I almost had a heart attack or a stroke and then I see the frozen account. I think to myself thats OK. Im going to just explain to them. Ive never had a problem before I have no idea what the problem is if its because I said a weird word in a description or something like that I thought it would be an easy fix. Seven hours later at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I get a message saying that the account is deactivated. I will no longer be able to have an account ever again with them and my funds that are in my account which are over XXXX will be held for up to 180 days and that they dont need to divulge any information and thats it. I never received any information whatsoever none whatsoever about why, even though I was told that the account specialist would be able to be the ones to tell me about that I didnt receive any information they give me a vague automated response on a holiday from obviously a robot without giving me any clue rhyme or reason why it happened or how to go about resolving the issue or having the account reinstated. Ive actually heard about consumer finance through XXXX  post of other people that had the same exact issue with XXXXXXXX  I mean many many many people have had the same issue about their vague policies and their vague reasoning and theyre terrible, terrible lockouts, and the activations for no good reasons. Immediately, when I found out about the account being frozen, I sent out a picture of my identification. I told them I looked at all of the transactions. I even did things on my own accord. I changed my password just to prove to them that it was me. I set up the security thing where it scans my face or I put in a passcode. I did everything possible so then that way when the account specialist see my account they see that I did all of the steps necessary ahead of time. Then pondering, how could my account possibly be frozen when as soon as I receive the money I had sent funds to my fiancs stepfather and to his aunt one of XXXX and another of XXXX. I told them I can literally confirm every single thing that has happened on the account. I received the funds late XXXX XXXXt and found out XXXX XXXX the funds were locked. My cat had no food. He had just ran out of food in the home so I had ordered around XXXX worth of food and litter for him which the money was put on hold because XXXX does not take the money until the packages actually get delivered. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX you were supposed to receive the food for him. Saturday I went to withdraw XXXX from an ATM. It didnt work. I went to go over to a food market named XXXX to do cashback that didnt work. I talk to myself what could possibly a froze my account I bought XXXX XXXX  that morning as well and spent XXXX between me and my fianc for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Everything was fine until we went to use the ATM so we thought maybe we reached some sort of withdrawal limit even though we werent withdrawing it like that out of any ATMs. We thought you know what this happened before a long time ago in XXXX it took like six hours to a lot. Lets just wait. We receive a vague message that the account was frozen. We reach out to customer support. They tell us that the account is frozen, but its not because we owe money to banks or institution and it will take 3 to 5 business days. We were like oh my gosh, this was horrific news for us because this money we were waiting on for a long time and this could put a huge hamper in everything. We already have bills that are desperately needed to be paid. We were waiting on this money to solve lots of issues. Our cat still does not have any food. We have no food. This is not something you can play around with with somebodys life and give them a vague message without giving any explanation so the customer support says all they can see on their end is that they see that its frozen but not from owing money so they say anything else that has to deal with frozen accounts you have to reach out through email to talk to the advanced account specialist. Unfortunately, theyre only open Monday through Friday and they told me that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. day or man that I wont be able to speak with anyone although Monday comes around and at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I receive another email saying that my account is frozen and then seven hours later aXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I receive an email saying the account is permanently deactivated. They said they cant divulge the information why and they told me my funds will be able to be transferred or available after 180 days.  I never seen this in any of the writing any of the print. This is very vague automated response from a robot on Monday seven hours apart of how I just wont be able to receive my funds and pretty much I could end up homeless and me and my fianc would literally lose everything The first thing we did when we found out it was frozen is I XXXX XXXX sent out my identification and then on top of it just to get ahead of the game just in case they were to observe my account on Monday. I ended up changing my password and setting up the security feature where it scans my face and I can put in the passcode. I also sent them an email stating that I seen all the transactions. Everything was approved and I dont understand why the account could possibly be frozen. My fianc and I work at the same job and we have the same boss and weve been together for going on a decade so we start to think you know what I did a rapid refund loan to be able to receive XXXX for my fiancs taxes. We talked to the boss, and he said that it was probably frozen because my fianc whose name doesnt need to be mentioned here set the funds to be sent to my account on XXXX Right away, we ask them to not be so vague we beg them how important this was us and that we could lose everything and to at least give us somewhat of an explanation or at least confirm the information of what we think or at least give us some sort of explanation into why or how we could fix the account any sort of explanation on what we need to be able to resolve this issue and be able to get the funds transferred. Like I said when we heard 3 to 5 business days our jobs hit the ground and now were hearing 180 days without any explanation or any avenues on how to fix the issue. I believe in security and everything as well, but for something that can easily be explained and they have such terrible customer support and they just have automated messages. Sending us messages without giving us any reason or way how to fix this is mind-boggling and I demand that these funds get released or to reactivate the account. My fianc has lived with me for years and years and years were on many of the same bills together. It was an honest mistake. It was XXXX from a XXXX XXXX XXXX so now we have over XXXX blocked inside my XXXX  account. Not only did I send my identification. I did a follow up email sending my identification and his identification showing and stating that we have lived together in the same address, not only that I have sent them a bill for a phone bill showing both of the phones on both of our XXXX accounts that are in the same XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX My fianc also logged into his XXXX that he created to resend the same message and to also show them my ID and his ID and the XXXXy bill just to show like hey the number thats on my XXXX account and the number thats on her XXXX  account. Were on the same bill and we live together and they just give us a simple and easy way to be able to resolve this issue without us starving and losing our home and our cat going hungry and our Internet and all of our bills and our electric being shut off we were depending on this money. This is an absolute sham of a system. Like I said, I believe insecurities, but something so lazy without any warning, and to be honest, this is the first time that either of us have ever just had an account frozen to just freeze it and then automatically seven hours later. Send us an email when theyre not even in the office saying that its deactivated and That I will never be able to open our account again and that I can expect to see my funds within 180 business days, which scares me because then I go into XXXX  and I go on the forums and there has been hundreds if not thousands of people that have had the same issue with XXXX but they have had lots of money, locked inside their accounts and lost many things because of it.  I have heard that consumer finance is very reputable and because of the willingness and ethic nature and wanting to help people they have gotten peoples funds released from XXXX within literally a day or two. This is a very long message because I am in excruciating disbelief that they have such a ridiculous policy of 180 days without giving any avenue or way to be able to confirm any information and especially for somebodys first simple mistake on an account. My fianc is literally right next to me right now were appalled by this. We actually love to XXXX and now because of this we have a forever bad taste in our mouth and we want this to be resolved and we would love to be able to reinstate our account but before anything we need to have our funds released we have the same boss, the same boss Whose name wont be mentioned  had sent the money to my account and the XXXX deposit about 25 minutes later from the rapid refund loan from doing the taxes and we never thought thats such a small mistake of sending money from my fiancs tax return, which was a rapid refund loan would literally freeze deactivate our account where the funds that we desperately needed would completely put such a financial burden in our lives, we were so excited to finally receive some of our money. Now or possibly looking at eviction because we know our budget and we know we wont make enough now and on top of that we dont know how were going to eat. We dont know how were going to feed our animals and we dont know how were going to pay our electric and our Internet bill This is a complete disgrace. I feel like this is a sham. I feel like its the most vague ridiculous terrible customer support. Were almost every answer that any question can be answered other than froze accounts that dont have to do with owed money or outstanding balances. We reached out to them. We asked them what we can possibly do. I sent my ID to them immediately and took all the right avenues so then when they would look at the account, they would see I changed my password and everything else just to show them that it was me. I reached out and told them that all the transactions Were fine. I have practically begged them for them to give me a reason to whats going on and customer service over the phone tells us that the advanced account specialist will let us know and then they tell us that they cant and then they give us a crazy message seven hours later stating that our funds will be released within 180 days. 3 to 5 business days was absolutely crazy. I asked them why not one to five business days so I had them put a notation on the account so that maybe they could see the message sooner but then we get an automated message on a holiday saying that the account is frozen and then deactivated And now were possibly looking at losing everything we have in love because XXXX  has no way explaining anything to us or to release the funds to us or tell us how we can correct the issue or to transfer the funds out. like I said, my fianc has sent out a message stating the exact message he sent both of our IDs. I sent both of our IDs. We explained the situation we showed the bill where our phone numbers for both of our separate XXXXXXXX  accounts are both on one bill. We have asked them in every possible way to be able to fix this. I mean to even release at least all the other funds and at least figure out a way to get the XXXX put to a financial account for my fianc whatever or however, they would want to do it. They are not compliant. They wont get any good reason they dont tell us how to fix the problem. Im absolutely discouraged and sad and just feel hopeless now because of this please Im begging you begging you to please give us even even a reasonable a small answer or they even confirm that what we think might have froze the account because of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from my fianc into the account why cant they even confirm that or why cant they give us any reason or avenues on how to fix the issue?  There is no way that we are able to wait 180 days if we dont have the funds released within this week or have a way to transfer the funds out of my account then we are absolutely doomed because such bad policies and such bad customer support. As you can see, they sent a message at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which was an automated response obviously saying that its permanently deactivated I end up sending them a very long message which I didnt include in this because it has lots of personal information explaining to them what happened and asking for any avenues on that to fix the situation because thats what customer service And support keep telling us to do and that they would explain it to us and final waste unblock it even on the XXXX  support help center. It says to talk to them in email to find a way to be able to release the fun sooner, etc. etc. so just approve that they dont care and they keep sending the same message they sent the same message back to backwithout having any human compassion or sympathy. Youll see this timestamps for one at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and then another one before I believe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the same day so a few hours later.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",FL,33311,,Consent provided,Web,02/24/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,12201472.0

01-09-2025,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"Based upon an offer provided by my Amex XXXX card to earn a {$200.00} statement credit for booking a stay at an eligible XXXX XXXX, I booked the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year> for {$250.00}. Amex confirmation # XXXX. Hotel confirmation # XXXX After the booking, I inquired with amex why I had not received the {$200.00} statement credit and the promised XXXX Membership Rewards points on the booking. They responded that the hotel stay I booked was ineligible becaus it was not a pre-paid rate. According to the terms of the XXXX statement credit "" A prepaid booking is referred to as Pay Now on Amextravel.com and in the Amex App ''. 

During the booking process on amextravel.com, after selecting a room at the hotel, a pop-up is given to allow the selection of "" Pay Now '', "" Pay with Points '', or "" Pay Later ''. I selected Pay Now and proceeded to checkout knowing that I had followed the terms of the credit. What I did not know at the time was that the amextravel website automatically reverted the stay to a "" deposit '' based prepaid stay ( even after clicking "" Pay Now '' and not "" Pay Later '' ) that made it ineligible for the credit. There was no verbiage on the page that said this made the stay ineligible for XXXX or made it a pre-paid rate. Indeed, I relied upon the fact that the selection of "" Pay Now '' at the pop-up was following the terms of the credit as any rational person would have done. 

I escalated this issue with amex travel and they refused to honor the credit and said I would need proof of the exact instance happening during booking. Of course, it would be absurd knowing I should've taken a screenshot of an apparent website glitch that I didn't know had happened until days after the booking. 

I contend that the amextravel.com website was performing an extremely misleading bait & switch tactic of making the user think they would select a "" Pay Now '' stay and then automatically reverting it to a deposit-based stay and making it ineligible for credit.

I found multiple instances of this happening when I tried test bookings after the fact and took screenshots of the page where it advertised "" Pay Now '' only to silently switch to a deposit based stay. These screenshots are attached to this complaint. Note that since the time I took these screenshots reproducing the behavior, it appears amextravel.com has resolved the glitch and I can no longer can find an instance of it happening. At the time it was happening at multiple XXXX XXXX hotels such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, etc. However, I also contend Amex is aware of this behavior as XXXX of the chat representatives I spoke with indicated that it was possible for a user to select Pay Now and for it to still revert to a pre-paid rate. My only guess is that Amex is silently switching users to a pre-paid rate when they have no post-paid stays available - certainly this is something they need to remedy to avoid misleading more users. 

I provided this info to the amex global complaint team who provided XXXX attempt at resolution and stated that even if they were aware of such an issue ocurring on their website that it wouldn't be sufficient to provide compensation for the glitch. This is extremely frustrating to have amex promise a credit to entice a consumer to make a booking, and then use an extremely misleading tactic to make said booking ineligible for the credit, and provide XXXX recourse to resolve the issue. 


I have provided screenshots of the bookings showing the behavior I encountered. In addition I have provded a printout of the forum at the following link XXXX XXXX XXXX This forum shows multiple other amextravel users who have encountered the same glitch and the same misleading tactics that resulted in Amex avoiding having to pay out the XXXX credit.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,90278,,Consent provided,Web,01-09-2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11458295.0

She has kindly offered to help me with her offer, using it to pay part of my balance at Barclays. TWICE I HAD CHECKS SENT and TWICE, Barclay screwed up and the payment was not made!! I I am writing so I have a written record of my complaint, and I want to receive an answer also IN WRITING from Barclay, indicating EXACTLY WHERE I HAVE TO SEND THE CHECK AND WHEN IT WILL BE CREDITED. 
I am extremely frustrated and will not waste my time on phone calls anymore! I have spent too many hours over many phone calls with Barclay, since XXXX. I have explained it is impossible for me to keep making payments at Barclay 's high interest rates. I have been in and out of the hospital since XX/XX/2023 due to a serious XXXX XXXX. I am trying to transfer some of my high debt at Barclays to my mothers bank so I can keep my credit rating, but it has been ridiculously difficult to consummate a simple balance transfer. What kind of a Bank are you? 
I first had my mother 's bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a representative and was told the balance transfer could NOT BE MADE ELECTRONICALLY and I had to send a PAPER CHECK to XXXX 's main US office in Delaware. I was surprised that a bona fide, modern bank would not be able to receive electronic payments but in good faith I complied. 
XX/XX/XXXX : My mother asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to send the {$2000.00} check there by mail on XX/XX/XXXX, which they did right away. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I saw the payment had not been made so I figured it the paper check was lost in the mail. My mother asked XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to put a stop payment on that check and to issue another check for the amount of {$2000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I asked where this second check should be sent, since the first check never made it. Barclay gave me a different address in a po box in California. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the SECOND PAPER CHECK for {$2000.00} by mail to that address. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Seeing the payment was not made by the second check, I again called Barclay. The rep said that was not the right address and offered to give me a DIFFERENT ADDRESS!! That is, place another stop-payment, be charged for it, and then have XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX send another check by mail!!! I respectfully declined and said I would just wait for it to arrive XX/XX/XXXX : My mother received a letter from her bank saying that Barclays SENT BACK the check, claiming it had the wrong account number!! At this point I figured out that Barclay is playing a dishonest game, trying to avoid transferring my balance there is no other explanation. I called Barclays and they said the check was made out for my bank account at XXXXXXXX XXXX, which is the bank I use to pay Barclay monthly. There is no way my mothers bank made out the check made out a check for that account, because my mother does not have my XXXX account number! So clearly, Barclay is either inept or deliberately messed up the balance transfer. 
I am completely at a loss for words. I am livid that a simple balance transfer has been so difficult.

We have attached the flawed or no good documentation that XXXX presented. And BOA did not even give us an opportunity to response to this fraud. 

And XXXX is stating they are not responsible for vendors they present to the Public. If this was a XXXX company, that statement would not fly. 

And we REFUSE to give them more time because this issue can been going on since XX/XX/XXXX. My lord, that is over months. Every time they mention 90 days, they move the ball further. They told us XXXX in XXXX of XXXX and we are about to go in XX/XX/XXXX.

2. Unreasonable and Unfair Dispute Timeframe : The bank claims that I had only one ( 1 ) business day to dispute the ACH transaction, which is inconsistent with industry fraud protection standards and unreasonable given that I was unaware of the transaction at the time.

3. Lack of Fraud Investigation and Due Diligence : The bank has failed to properly investigate the fraudulent nature of the ACH withdrawal and has simply denied my dispute without reviewing supporting evidence. 
4. Failure to Escalate the Issue Properly : I requested direct contact with the fraud and legal departments, but the bank refused to provide a legal contact. 
The banks representative was dismissive, unprofessional, and unwilling to assist in my efforts to recover the stolen funds. 
5. Failure to Take Action Against a Fraudulent Recipient : I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX at the phone number listed on their website, only to be told that the number was not associated with any business. This strongly suggests fraudulent activity. 

Requested Resolution : I am formally requesting that regulatory agencies investigate Mountain America Credit Unions mishandling of my dispute and require the following corrective actions : 1. Provide Proof of Authorization : The bank must provide written documentation proving that I explicitly authorized this ACH transaction. 
2. Initiate a Fraud Investigation : The bank must take steps to investigate this unauthorized ACH withdrawal, rather than dismissing it based on an arbitrary deadline. 
Mountain America Credit Union must initiate a dispute through XXXX and attempt to recover the funds. 
3. Reevaluate and Extend the ACH Dispute Window : The bank must change its policy regarding ACH dispute timeframes for fraud cases.

Business customers should have a reasonable amount of time ( such as 30 to 60 days ) to dispute fraudulent transactions.

4. Assist in Law Enforcement Investigation : Since XXXX XXXX XXXX appears to be fraudulent, the bank must provide full cooperation with law enforcement and provide any information it has regarding the recipients account. 
5. Reimbursement of Funds ( if negligence is determined ) : If it is found that Mountain America Credit Union failed to follow proper XXXX or regulatory procedures, I request that the full amount of {$69000.00} be reimbursed to my account. 

Next Steps : If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will be forced to pursue legal action against Mountain America Credit Union and XXXX XXXX XXXX, including filing a formal fraud complaint with law enforcement and initiating civil litigation. 

I appreciate your immediate attention to this complaint and request confirmation of receipt.",,MOUNTAIN AMERICA FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NV,89052,,Consent provided,Web,02-10-2025,Closed with explanation,Yes,,12015866.0

Specifically, I was not notified of alterations to the type of account, fee structure, or terms associated with my account. It has come to my attention that my Savings account was converted to a Checking account, either during the migration to Truist in XXXX or potentially at an earlier date. 

I had been a longstanding and valued customer of the institution, with savings income reported on IRS Form 1099-INT from XXXX through XXXX, as evidenced by the attached documentation. During this period, my account accrued interest exceeding {$400.00} in certain years. However, from XXXX through XXXX, I did not receive any 1099-INT forms, and no communication was provided regarding changes that may have impacted the interest-bearing status of my account. 

My trust in the institution began to waver when, in XXXX, I encountered difficulties accessing my account via a newly issued ATM card. I was informed that I was being disruptive and allegedly unable to complete a basic Fast Cash withdrawal. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my account was now classified as a Checking account, and I was required to select this option when using the ATM. This revelation left me dissatisfied with the apparent lack of care and management regarding the status of my accounts. 

I subsequently took steps to rectify the situation by upgrading my Truist Checking account to a Truist One Checking, thereby restoring the ability to earn interest that had previously been suspended. However, when attempting to convert the problem savings/ "" checking '' account into a Truist One Savings account, I was informed that I did not meet the qualifications for such an account, though I had the minimum balance. As a result, I chose to close the second Checking account, as I did not wish to maintain two Checking accounts under these circumstances.

I was told by the teller that the funds would be available that night or the next day, Saturday. I check both Friday night and saw that the funds ( {$24000.00} ) were in my account and available to use. I then went to the same bank to the same teller and asked if the funds were there and I was able to use them. He said yes, they were there, the money was mine, and I could do what I wanted them. So I had him make out a certified check from my account of the same amount ( {$24000.00} ) to send, which he did. I then mailed this check to my client. 3 days later. Bank of America informed me that the first check was fraudulent and therefore the funds were not there. I was now in a major financial hole because of this bad check. To me, I have to believe my bank as they are the professionals and are there to protect me as well as following procedures. Not once, even after several inquires, was I told to hold off on the funds until the bank had cleared the check, but was informed that the money was there and there weren't any issues. I have had a major nightmare dealing with this as I believe it is up to the bank to let me know that certified checks need to be held for a certain length and not told it was good and I had the money in my account. I have contacted everyone from the bank branch manager to the President of Bank of America and they have all told me, it was my problem because I'm supposed to that the ceriftied check was good to begin with. I was told that the funds were only in my account as a loan until the check cleared. Totally news to me. I am not a banker, nor do I have any professional background in finance and therefore I put my total trust in my bank, which I have been a client with Bank of America for over 45 years. I don't know if this will do any good or if I'm even able to argue their answer, but I feel that since I was told, 3 times, by the bank, that the money was there, all was good, and I had nothing to worry about. I would love to have the bank not only acknowledge their mistake and take the right actions to fix my problem which would be to reimburse me. As of this writing, I have not heard from anyone from Bank of America and I feel that they have told their company not to talk to me for legal reasons. I do hope that I am not subjected to retribution for filing this report and would just like to see my side seen by a third party.

My issue is that this seems to be a simple thing to do through this financial tech company since they do not ask for any physical proof that you are who you say you are. I am not sure what the scam is since they used my actual e-mail but from what others have mentioned online is fraudsters will fund your Chime account with a payday loan and spend it but then you are somehow on the hook for the cash. Chime needs a more robust security screening process as they are an easy target for criminals.

Despite numerous attempts to seek resolution through Venmo 's customer support, I have not received satisfactory assistance or a clear path to resolving the problem. 

On XX/XX/2023, I encountered a persistent and recurring issue with my Venmo account. Specifically, I received a "" 0Auth Exception Error '' while attempting to access my account and perform various transactions. This error has not only disrupted my ability to make payments but has also caused significant frustration and inconvenience. 

Upon encountering this issue, I promptly reached out to Venmo 's customer support for assistance in resolving the problem. My ticket numbers are XXXX and XXXX. In my initial contact, I explained the situation in detail and provided all necessary information, including my account details and the specific error message received. 

However, the response I received from Venmo 's customer support was far from satisfactory. Their only advice was to "" wait for 24 hours and try again. '' When I inquired further about what to do if the issue persisted after waiting, I was simply told to "" wait again. '' This lack of clear guidance and concrete steps to address the problem has left me feeling frustrated and unsupported as a Venmo user. 

I have diligently followed Venmo 's instructions, waiting as advised, but the issue continues to persist. 

This issue has had a direct impact on my financial transactions and has caused undue stress and inconvenience. It is my belief that Venmo has failed to fulfill its responsibility to provide adequate customer support and resolve technical issues promptly. 

Therefore, I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to ensure that Venmo addresses this issue promptly and provides clear, effective guidance to users facing similar problems. 


I am hopeful that your intervention will lead to a swift resolution of this issue and prevent other Venmo users from experiencing similar frustrations. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt response. 

Thank you for your assistance.

06/24/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"My account was charged off with 5/3 on XX/XX/XXXX with no prior notice. A letter was issued to me on XX/XX/XXXX and I logged into my account to rectify the negative balance on XX/XX/XXXX and saw the letter. I have not yet received the correspondance. No phone call, no email was attempted. There was NO advance warning of the account being charged off. The account went negative on XX/XX/XXXX for {$34.00}. I was charged a {$37.00} OD fee on XX/XX/XXXX. If 5/3rds policy is to charge off accounts 60 days after the account is negative, the XXXX day was XX/XX/XXXX. The account was closed XX/XX/XXXX. 

I attempted to rectify the situation on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I had to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to do. After calling the customer service line 5 times, being routed to several incorrect departments, I was told to "" leave a message '' at some random department with NO idea of how long I would wait for a call back. I was given the number of XXXX by a XXXX Representative on the chat function and I called that number. The representative answered "" this is XXXX on a record line, how can I help you? "" ... .I asked if this was FIfth Third and he said "" yes ''. 

I have worked in the banking industry for 23 years. I will never give my information out on the phone to a number I do not recognize, especially when the agent answers the phone as above AND was incorrect. That number is directly to XXXX XXXX that purchased the debt from 5/3. I did research and found the customer service line and they confirmed who there were and transferred me to a specialist to assist me. I paid the debt. I was told that it would NOT effect my credit but WAS reported to XXXX. After 14 days it would show as in good standing but will remain with them for at least 7 years. This could effect me opening new accounts in the future. Fifth Third sold the debt between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and made NO attempt at trying to rectify the situation with me prior to selling to a collections agency that then reported me. 

In short ; Fifth third made NO attempt to : 1 ) notify me of the charge off date 2 ) gave me FALSE information to try and rectify the situation 3 ) when I DID try and rectify the situation I was sent all over creation to try and fix with NO resolution. I had to take it upon myself to figure it out. 
4 ) {$37.00} of the {$70.00} charge off was a fee from Fifth Third.

5 ) I was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I find this to be absolutely absurd customer service in handling the situation. I find this to be extremely predatory and a violation of my consumer rights. XXXX XXXX assisted me and was cordial and helpful. 5/3 did not.

please pass this complaint on to whomever it needs to go to.

02/25/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Summary : XXXX XXXX made a copy of my check, whitewashed it, typed out fake details, and paid herself {$2500.00} out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a report immediately with Chase Bank, and it got lost in the system, without any record on their end. I re-filed the claim on XX/XX/XXXX. Chase Bank denies responsibility in repayment of stolen funds on the grounds that I did not file a claim within 60 days. They asked for proof of first contact, I faxed it to them, then they immediately returned to their original stance of denial, suggesting filing a police report. 

XX/XX/XXXX - The most recent legitimate check I had wrote ; to XXXX XXXX and XXXX of XXXX for {$130.00}. I had placed it in the XXXX XXXX on XXXX in the parking lot of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as it was the closest to my house and I did not have the ability to leave it in my mailbox to be collected since it locks. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received a fraud confirmation text from Chase asking to reply XXXX or XXXX. I pulled up my account app and looked at the check in question- obviously white washed and typed on, I always hand write checks. The check number was also out of sequence - I only ever get XXXX printed at a time directly from my bank. As I was about to respond, I received a call from a Chase Fraud Customer Service Representative and she filed a case on my behalf. I forgot to ask for a case number and I can not recall her name. 
Shortly after the call, I received a text from Chase as a receipt of the call with a code. 

After the fraud on XX/XX/XXXX, I backtracked. I called the business ( XXXX XXXX ) and it got directed to a third party answering service twice. It seemed I needed to go more direct to confirm if they had indeed received my payment. I visited them in person right after the holiday and they confirmed my accounts balance has been resolved and they received my payment. 
( In my checking account, I could see that on the back of the legit check, it was stamped with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX and received by XXXX Bank ) XX/XX/XXXX - Next, I visited the XXXX Chase Branch on XXXX XXXX for assistance with closing the compromised account. She printed me a paper with my new account number so I could provide it for my work to update my direct deposit. I also asked her where I could expect the money to be deposited - worried it would be delivered into the closed checking account and inaccessible, but she responded that I should expect for it to go into the new checking account, and that the old one would close in 90 days. 

A few weeks, then a couple months had passed. I had been checking my new account often to see if my money had been returned to me. I looked for information online about some sort of timeline and read that Chase takes longer than other banks, so I waited patiently. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I called Chase Fraud department and was connected with a customer service agent named XXXX. She could not find any record that the XXXX was reported, stating It would have shown on our files that we spoke with you and looked into your account. I was puzzled, and began to have doubts I spoke with a legitimate agent in the first place. She offered to file a claim for me at that time since XXXX was not filed yet. She gave me a confirmation number. Looking at this, it was XXXX numbers long, and so was the code that I was texted on XX/XX/XXXX, perhaps that might have been a case number as well. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received an email from Chase bank ( XXXX verified sender ) with the subject You received a new letter and further stating that We have updated information about your claim. Since I opted for paperless notices, it gave instructions on how to find this in my account. I have been unable to find any notice from that day through today XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX - I called Chase Fraud department to inquire on the claim update, since I was unable to see what I had been sent. He told me since the claim filed on XX/XX/XXXX was over 60 days past the date on the fraudulent check, the claim had been denied. This was unfair because to the best of my belief, I filed a claim on the same day as the fraud. He told me this was impossible and Chase had no record of this. He continued denying that I had filed an earlier claim, I continued to try to stick up for myself. He then offered that I can provide proof of this contact and fax it to them or deliver it to a Chase Branch. I thanked him and set to work at this task. 

I printed screenshots of the phone number on the call history that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX, the confirm Y/N text, and the text receipt from after the call. I went to the Chase Branch on XXXX this XXXX. I spent an hour with XXXX of the XXXX behind the desk assisting me on the phone with XXXX again. He confirmed the number that called me on XX/XX/XXXX was a legit extension line of the Chase Fraud department and felt my proof looked undeniable. He made sure to verify where exactly to send this proof and what they needed. This was faxed around XXXX. He advised me to come back in the next morning to check in and make contact again, confirming they had received my fax. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I went into the same branch and saw XXXX of the XXXX Chase associates that I had spoken with yesterday. She came back to the desks and called the XXXX line. The XXXX department confirmed that they received it and would check their records again and listen to call logs - as the calls are subject to recording for training purposes. I was told to expect an answer by the following Friday. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I still had not received reimbursement or any further electronic letters posted to my account. I went to the XXXX XXXX again. An associate came to the desk and connected me with the legit XXXX department number and gave the phone to me to tell the details of my inquiry. The XXXX agent said on XX/XX/XXXX it was decided ( regardless of the proof of first contact they asked me to submit ) that the case was denied and stuck to denial on the grounds that it had been past 60 days, quoted Chase policy, and could not make an exception. I responded that I had filed a claim on XX/XX/XXXX and they repeated the same thing back to me and said this is your fault, you should have called sooner. This time, they said there is nothing more Chase can do to assist me in this matter, but suggested filing a police report.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,96002,,Consent provided,Web,02/25/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,12200237.0

The representative assured me that my acct XXXX would not be linked, hindered or touched in anyway. After the company requested that I show them I deposited the check in my bank, they asked me if I could go ahead and buy the equipment from them to start my job. Since I told them the bank held the money for 10 days I became suspicious. I called the XXXX  XXXX XXXX to make sure the check was good before I would touch any of my money I deposited and talked to the head of the financial dept. and I even have her direct line for any questions. She told me the check was a scam and after giving her all the information to help her catch these fraudulent people she commended and thanked me. I in-turned called Truist immediately on XX/XX/XXXX and relayed the information to them and told them to make sure no money or activity would go on in that new acct ending in XXXX. I also made sure I cancelled the debit card they would have sent me also. I made sure I was a vigilant and upstanding customer to help them in anyway catch this check and not be out any monetary value. Again I was very concerned about my acct. ending in XXXX since it is my lifeline. I can not live eat or survive without the money I receive from SS & SSI. On XXXX/XXXX I called the bank again because they placed a hold on both of my accts which totally put my into a panic since I was already dealing with a state of emergency with XXXX XXXX and in a shelter unable to accesses my good funds. The representative apologized and was able to release the hold they put on my acct ending in XXXX and helped me open a new online banking password and ID. Then made sure and promised me that would not be touched again. And the bad acct ending in XXXX will be closed per my request. A banking institution could not ask for a better client as myself since I have protected them the whole way with these fraudulent funds and company that got to me. On XX/XX/XXXX when I was able to return home I needed gas and money for food and necessities my acct ending in XXXX again was blocked. I had to wait to call at XXXX and the girl said they had made a decision to close my acct and will eventually send me out a check in the mail for my balance of {$220.00} taking 7-10 days and sending back my SS & SSI checks to the government! This time frame is unacceptable! I needed money immediately as I was in a state of disaster from the hurricane and that was all the money I had in the world and {$0.00} cash in pocket.

To provide some backstory here, I more recently reached out to the platform to request a ban similar to how casinos allow people to ban themselves from XXXX 

The way Robinhood had everything setup and the trades they were allowing me to take, subsequently led to me basically losing over XXXX in the last 2 years. I went through bankruptcy etc. But I was still addicted to the platform and kept putting money into it. 

Well after things came to a turning point, I requested a full ban because I did not trust myself to have access. They did alot to dissuade me and I have proof of this. They at first suggested no such ban was even possible and that the most they would do is basically nothing. 

After making a ton of noise about this, they finally agreed to ban me from the platform. 

This being said, I just got an email today suggesting I owe Robinhood {$1400.00}. 

A reasonable person would simply call the company or get in contact for a quick explanation on how that is possible. Unfortunately, Robinhood hides their contact information. Its not possible to find their phone number nor find their email contacts. 

They have an inner part that handles support chats. So I went to use this support chat as I had used it in the past. This particular issue is not something they allow me to chat about. Thus they are refusing to actually speak with me about how the money is owed, where this figure is coming from and why it just suddenly came up after I left the platform and requested my ban. 

This has caused me alot of emotional duress. I have lost work related deals, lost time at work and real money to the platform itself. There is really no solution that does enough here. But they can start by saying I dont owe them anything because I dont. 

I'm unsure what documentation would be needed here. I have screen shots all covering the broad spectrum of issues at play here.",,ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.,MI,482XX,,Consent provided,Web,10-01-2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10307254.0

After several conversations, the guys sent me about XXXX different pictures of 3 reconditioned wood stoves I was considering for a new home I'm building in XXXX, while I'm currently living in XXXX. We agreed on a price of {$900.00} for the XXXX I wanted, and on XX/XX/2024 I sent a deposit of {$350.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX on his XXXX account referenced by phone number XXXX. The {$350.00} was paid by my Bank of America Business account # XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, this XXXX sent me a XXXX message saying they had a death in the family, and he would be out of town for a few weeks, and wanted to complete the sale. After much thought, I sent the man the {$550.00} balance, plus another {$250.00} for shipping. The {$800.00} was paid by my Bank of America personal account # XXXX. 

XXXX minutes later, I received an email from a shipping company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, telling me my tracking # XXXX which could be tracked at : XXXX. Tracking showed the stove to be shipped XX/XX/XXXX, arriving at my new house XX/XX/XXXX, while I was there. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I got another email from the trucking company wanting another {$650.00} "" refundable insurance ''. At that point, I knew I was scammed. The man tried to convince me that he would pay {$350.00}, so that I only had to pay another {$300.00}. After considerable research, I learned the man was a fraud, frequently scamming others, the Trucking website was his fake site in an attempt to scam people of even more money. 

I immediately tried to contact XXXX, but they won't talk to you if you sent money from your Bank of America app, you have to contact bank directly, which I did. I filed two claims, since 2 separate accounts paid. About 10 days later, I received 2 form letters saying they were denying my claims, they paid the money I told them to, and it was gone. They forwarded info to XXXX to investigate. Completely furious that BoA nor XXXX seems to have an interest in me reclaiming my money, or stopping others from being scammed, I called and complained to Bank of America again, then called XXXX and complained. Both just kept referring to legal jargon in their terms of service as justification for doing NOTHING. Then, a few days later I got a credit of {$170.00} in my account, no explanation, then a letter a few days later saying the claim was paid and closed. Like I'm supposed to be satisfied.

In XX/XX/year>, my businessXXXX XXXX based in XXXX XXXX, XXXX expecting a check payment from a client, XXXX XXXX. The check, made out to XXXX XXXX, never arrived. After weeks of follow-up, I discovered that the check had been stolen, and someone had forged my signature and mobile-deposited the check into their personal Capital One bank account. 

Despite the fact that : The name on the check did not match the account holders, The signature was obviously forged, The check was made out to a registered business ( XXXX XXXX XXXX not an individual, Capital One allowed the deposit and cleared the funds without properly verifying the endorsement. 

Eventually, after I discovered the fraud and worked with the original issuer, the funds were recovered from the fraudsters account. However, I find it deeply troubling that : 1. Capital Ones internal controls were so lax that this could occur at all, 2. The person who committed the fraud has seemingly faced no consequences, 3. I, as a small business owner, was forced to resolve this issue myself, without any outreach or support from Capital One.

I believe this situation demonstrates a clear failure of internal controls and due diligence by Capital One in accordance with applicable banking standards and potentially a violation of the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) 3-406 and 4-401 regarding forged endorsements and bank liability.

I am requesting a formal investigation into : Capital Ones endorsement verification and mobile deposit procedures, How a check made out to a business could be deposited by an unrelated third party, What enforcement or corrective actions, if any, have been taken against the fraudster.

This incident caused unnecessary disruption and stress to my operations, and it raises serious concerns about how Capital One handles fraud and protects non-customers impacted by its account holders actions.
